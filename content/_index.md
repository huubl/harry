I focus on creating hand-coded [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) websites, with tools like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

I also write [articles on building websites](/articles/) and curate [a ~~weekcly~~ monthly newsletter](/newsletter/) mainly for front-end web developers. When I remember I try and keep [notes on things](/notes/) I’m learning.

## Where to go next

You can find out [what I'm up to right now](/now/) or check out [a few recent projects](/projects/) to see what I’ve been working on lately. Read about some of the [ways you can work with me](/work-with-me/), or take a look at [my CV](pdf/harry-cresswell-cv-may-20.pdf) to get an idea of my experience.

Find out [how I buit this site](/build/) if you’re more interested in that. I’ve tried my best to list all the tools and techniques I used. Check out my [uses](/uses/) page, if you want to know about my office setup and the tools I use most days.

Find me on [Github](https://github.com/harrycresswell), [Codepen](https://codepen.io/harrycresswell) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell) if you have questions. Very occassionally I check my [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/harrycresswell), but I’m not very good at responding.
