Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## A new look for In Detail

“We believe in the merits of slowing down. Taking time. Going into detail.”

— In Detail Manifesto

This week saw the launch of [a new look for In Detail](https://indtl.com/), introducing new features like the [glossary](https://indtl.com/glossary), [team](https://indtl.com/about#team) section and [author profiles](https://indtl.com/author/sarah-royce-greensill). We’ve worked hard to improve the reading experience, setting the type exclusively in [Calluna](https://www.exljbris.com/pdf/Calluna_specimen.pdf) and [Calluna Sans](https://exljbris.com/pdf/Calluna_Sans_specimen.pdf) and using [a modular scale](https://trello.com/c/fft28TH7/15-typography-scales-and-spacing-units) for consistency and rhythm. In line with the [manifesto](https://indtl.com/manifesto), we hope this will facilitate a slower, more enjoyable and thought provoking read. On the flip side Luke’s been working hard on improving overall speed and site performance, to ensure content is delivered as fast as possible regardless of the device.

[We need design that is faster and design that is slower](http://www.zeldman.com/2018/02/24/need-design-faster-design-slower/) from Jeffrey Zeldman pretty much sums up what all this good stuff is about.

## A good looking book on design systems

“Solid principles are the foundation for any well-functioning system.”

[Design Systems](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/design-systems-book/) by UX and Interaction Designer [Alla Kholmatova](https://twitter.com/craftui) is next on my reading list. If this [sample chapter on design principles](http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/design-systems-chapter-2.pdf?_ga=2.82320661.2076494646.1519983221-906110657.1506159025) is anything to go by then it’s bound to become essential reading for all designers and design teams.

## Font Bookmarking with FontFaceDojo

A while back I shared an awesome browser extension called [FontfaceNinja](https://fontface.ninja/) which lets you highlight type on any website (similar to [Fontanello](https://fontanello.oktavilla.se/) but better) to find out the font used and where to buy it. You can now extend this great little tool with [FontFaceDojo](https://fontfacedojo.com/), which lets you bookmark those fonts for later. Think [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) for typography. Pretty neat.

## A few more good reads on type

I found a few good reads on type this week so I’m just going to throw them out there. Hopefully you might find a few useful.

Zell Liew on [responsive vertical rhythm with CSS variables and Calc](https://zellwk.com/blog/responsive-vertical-rhythm/).

[Understanding web fonts and getting the most out of them](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-web-fonts-getting/) by Thierry Blancpain, founder of [Grilli Type](https://www.grillitype.com/).

And this short read on a few of [Mathew Smiths favourite type foundries](http://mattymatt.co/what-font-is-that-and-a-small-list-of-type-foundries/).

## For your ears

[Gin Nation by Tiger and Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyZ6LnQI9hY). One of my favourites to help with focus and productivity.
