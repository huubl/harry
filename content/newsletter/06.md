Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [A guide to running a minimalist business](https://pjrvs.com/a/minbiz/) by Paul Jarvis. Such a great way of thinking for those of us who run a small business. Paul’s been running a successful solo design business for over 15 years, so he knows his stuff. He’s written [a ton of helpful articles](https://pjrvs.com/articles/) and also built [a great course on email marketing with Mailchimp](https://chimpessentials.com/).

2. [I started a new project](https://www.instagram.com/typeservices/) focused on hand drawn and painted type. I’m not quite sure where it’s heading yet but I’m sure it will make sense the more I do it. Just going to stick at it for now and see what happens.

3. I’ve been using [Strides](http://www.stridesapp.com/) for a few months now, mainly to help remind myself to practice yoga and meditation. It’s a great habit tracking app which you can use to set daily goals and track your progress. Seeing you current streak build up and not wanting to break it is a great way to self-motivate. Strides now also reminds me to do a daily type study and post it to Instagram. You could really use it for anything. Learning a new language perhaps?

4. Worth a watch: If you don’t quite get [all the Mars hype](https://www.space.com/37203-spacex-land-mars-rocket-launch-stand.html) then check out [The Mars Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2FEblUV-o4) on Netflix. It follows self-professed teenage “space nerds” at Space Camp, as they chase their dreams of traveling to Mars, while experts reflect on NASA’s history and future. It might sound like trash but it sheds some light on why space exploration is so important for humanity.

5. For your ears: A preview of [the upcoming Lapalux album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqzRsuiaYuo). I’m a huge fan of this guy. Sounds nice and ambient, but also pretty weird which I like. Looking forward to it’s release on the 30th.
