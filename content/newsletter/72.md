Hi folks,

Here are few links I felt were worth sharing this week.

## Thought provoking

_“The three questions we must ask when we are building things ‘To what end At what cost At whose expense.’”_

– Srinija Srinivasan

[A more deliberate way of living](https://zenhabits.net/deliberate/) by Leo Babauta.

## Design and Code

_“Increased openness about our design process has benefits for the designer, for the design community, and for society at large. Democratizing access to knowledge, tools, and methods will generally enable more designers to execute design — which means a bigger impact of our craft in everyone’s live.”_

[The State of UX Design in 2019](https://trends.uxdesign.cc/) from Fabricio Teixeira and Caio Braga.

Andy Bell on [Managing flow and rhythm with CSS Custom Properties](https://24ways.org/2018/managing-flow-and-rhythm-with-css-custom-properties/).

David Teodorescu on [Scarcity in UX: The psychological bias that became the norm](https://uxdesign.cc/scarcity-in-ux-the-psychological-bias-that-became-the-norm-3e666b749a9a).

## Typography

[Faro](https://luzi-type.ch/faro), the font that can smile or mourn from Luzi Type. Faro contains two moods Lucky and sad.

[Study](https://xyztype.com/fonts/study) from XYZ Type is a new typeface based on a hand-drawn alphabet published in 1968 by Czech-American designer and wood engraver Rudolph Ruzicka.

## Something to watch

[The Botanist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qozYFSIHxzM)–directed by Maxime Lacoste-Lebuis and Maude Plante-Husaruk–is an elegant, meditative portrait of Raïmberdi Mamatumarov, a Kyrgyz man who built his own hydroelectric power station in the mountains of Tajikistan.
