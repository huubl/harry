Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. In a world where everyone is shouting louder in order to be heard, [Primitive Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZGFTmK6Yk4) (I don’t even know his name) does his thing in total silence. There’s something refreshing about that. Watching his videos is one of my favourite ways to procrastinate, sometimes I don’t even watch them, I just listen to the sounds — great if you work at a computer. The best bit is [he learnt it all by reading books](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA/about). A faux-primitive [Elon Musk](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-elon-musk-learned-rocket-science-for-spacex-2014-10?IR=T), if you like.

2. I love hearing about peoples morning routines. I’ve been working on my own a lot this year and I’ll try to write about it when I have it down like [Kening Zhu](http://keningzhu.com/blog/everything-i-know-about-starting-a-morning-routine). This is a great article on how forming habits helps start the day off on the right foot.

3. Swiss design, posters and typefaces. [GT Walsheim](http://gt-walsheim.com/) is an awesome san serif inspired by these 3 things. I have my eye on at the moment, maybe one for an upcoming project.

4. It’s so easy to get caught [competing with the competition](https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/483151866256703103/). When I catch myself focusing too much of my attention on what Instagram friends are making, I look as far back as possible, to see what the greats were up to. [Giacometti’s sketches](https://goo.gl/p1s4TE), [Paul Rand’s iconic design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AUVXKG3F7o) or [Quentin Blake’s illustration](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/91/14/34/9114343cbe03c74640b5626178de27b4.gif), to name a few. Then I steal some ideas and try and make something better than I made yesterday. [Everything is a remix](https://vimeo.com/139094998).

5. For your ears: [Floating Points - Reflections - Mojave Desert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_vtGMUzPnM). I’ve been a huge fan of Floating points since seeing him play at [Worldwide](http://worldwidefestival.com/) a few years back. Now he’s playing with his band in the Mojave Desert. Love [the artwork](https://thevastnothingnessofspace.tumblr.com/post/160307943815/via-reflections-mojave-desert-luaka-bop) on this one — it’s all about those sand, tan and gold tones right now.
