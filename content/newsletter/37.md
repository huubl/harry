Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Using Media Queries In 2018

Rachael Andrew on [Using Media Queries For Responsive Design In 2018](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/media-queries-responsive-design-2018/). Great article covering syntax changes for Media Queries Level 4 and other best practices. If you haven’t seen it before checkout Brad Frost’s [7 Habits of Highly Effective Media Queries](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/7-habits-of-highly-effective-media-queries/) too. Old but still relevant.

## More good reads on CSS

[Modern CSS Explained for Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/actualize-network/modern-css-explained-for-dinosaurs-5226febe3525). A rather long but insanely good read on CSS. Where the hell it came from and how the hell to work with it.

[How I design with Grid](https://www.chenhuijing.com/blog/how-i-design-with-css-grid/#%F0%9F%92%BB) was a pretty cool read. I think we’ll see a lot more of these editorial style layouts on screens this year. Grid has exploded in popularity the last few months.

[Small Tweaks That Can Make a Huge Impact on Your Website’s Accessibility](https://css-tricks.com/small-tweaks-can-make-huge-impact-websites-accessibility/) from [Andy Bell](https://hankchizljaw.io/). A few great tools are mentioned in this article, namely [Tota11y](http://khan.github.io/tota11y/), a pretty cool accessibility visualization toolkit and [Contrast](https://usecontrast.com/), a macOS app for quick access to WCAG color contrast ratios.

## The Web 3.0

“The vision of a fairer and more transparent web dates back to around 2006, but the tools and technologies weren’t available for it to materialize. Bitcoin was still three years off, bringing with it the notion of a distributed ledger, or blockchain, for peer-to-peer digital storage. Decentralization was the idea; blockchain was the means. Now we have what is described as human-centered internet.”

Matteo Gianpietro Zago on [Why the Web 3.0 Matters and you should know about it](https://medium.com/@matteozago/why-the-web-3-0-matters-and-you-should-know-about-it-a5851d63c949).

## What I’ve been reading

I just finished the Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead. The story follows Cora, an African-American slave on the run to the free states via a network of secret routes and safe houses. It’s pretty dark throughout but extremely well written.

This week I started [SpaceX: From The Ground Up](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29490092-spacex-from-the-ground-up) which as you’d guess is the story of Space X and the Mars mission. It’s highly speculative but wil give you a good idea of how they plan to get there technically and financially.

On a separate space related note, I was recently reminded of [If the moon were only 1px](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html). A pretty cool way to kill some time on a Friday, I’d say.

## For your ears

[The Transformative Power of Classical Music](https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion), an impressive Ted Talk from English conductor [Benjamin Zander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Zander).
