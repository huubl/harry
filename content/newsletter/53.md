Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week

## Thought provoking

I finally published the second part of [Using Sketch Libraries to build a better UI design system](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell/using-sketch-libraries-to-build-a-better-ui-design-system-part-2-8de6cef5adc5) which looks at building atom level components like Avatars.

[Designing for accessibility is not that hard](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-for-accessibility-is-not-that-hard-c04cc4779d94) is a worthwhile read from Pablo Stanley.

[33 Books Every Designer Should Read](https://readinglist.design/): Some of industry’s best designers answer the question “What book should designers read and why?”

## Typography

[Inter UI](https://rsms.me/inter/) is specially designed for user interfaces with focus on high legibility of small-to-medium sized text on computer screens.

[Athletics](https://omsetype.co/athletics-2/), a monolinear sans serif from London based Type Foundry Omse Type. Extended strokes, asymmetric arcs, and a low aperture come together in a characterful yet functional typeface.

12 months. 12 fonts. [Font of the Month Club](https://fontofthemonth.club/) from [David Jonathan Ros](https://djr.com/about/)s is a subscription based service where a new font is delivered to your inbox every single month. Interesting approach to selling typefaces.

## Something to watch

In this [super insightful perescope](https://twitter.com/AlpenSheth/status/1003801975492730881), AngelList founder [Naval Ravikant](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-day-in-the-life-of-naval-ravikant-1477405801) discusses being present, eating healthy, not having goals, cryptocurrency and his current book recommendations.
