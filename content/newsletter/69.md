Hi Folks,

A few links I felt were worth sharing this week...

## Thought provoking

“So many people think you have to first call yourself an artist, know who you are and what you’re about, and then you can start making art… The important thing is the practice. The doing. The verb. We aren’t nouns, we are verbs. Forget the nouns, do the verbs.”
