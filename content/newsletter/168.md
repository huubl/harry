Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #168, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“Collaboration is a compounding investment: taken alone, each individual episode might not be optimal. Over time, the team learns and improves, gets more attuned to each other, uncovers surprising opportunities and novel strategies. That old saw: if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Matthew Ström in [The hand and the brain](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/the-hand-and-the-brain/)

“Most of my favorite websites out there are grown—homegrown in fact. They are corners of the web where some unique human has been nurturing, curating, and growing stuff for years. Their blog posts, their links, their thoughts, their aesthetic, their markup, their style, everything about their site—and themselves—shows growth and evolution and change through the years. It’s a beautiful thing, a kind of artefact that could never be replicated or manufactured on a deadline.”

## Typography

“We approached F37 to explore a custom font that delivered on the brand’s fun, quirky personality, while minding our modern and pioneering objectives. Taking cues from the logo, F37 was able to mirror its tapered edges and dynamic angles in a fresh and modern way that felt authentic to the brand and hit on all of the objectives we set out to accomplish.” Laura Crowder on [the new font for Baskin Robbins](https://f37foundry.com/custom-brand-fonts/baskin-robbins/).
