Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. “Our aim was to...deliver a consistent rebranded experience while tackling critical improvements to site architecture, code modularity, and overall performance and accessibility.” [Mina Markham](https://slack.engineering/@minamarkham), Senior Engineer runs through [the re-design and build of Slack.com](https://slack.engineering/rebuilding-slack-com-b124c405c193).

2. [Stop Designing For Only 85% Of Users: Nailing Accessibility In Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/nailing-accessibility-design/) is a great place to start if you're not familiar with design for accessibility.

3. [FontSelf Maker has a ton of new updates](https://blog.fontself.com/whats-new-in-fontself-maker-2-1-b0db4d7a8add). You can now create kerning pairs, ligatures, and discretionary alternates, making the software a viable option if you want to design decorative fonts. Check out [my typography collection on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@harrycresswell/collections/typography) for other great type tools.

4. I discovered [a great new podcast called Hurry Slowly](http://hurryslowly.co/), which looks at how you can be more productive, creative, and resilient through the simple act of slowing down.

5. [Timing](https://timingapp.com/) automatically tracks where you're spending your time. Pretty cool for productivity nerds or if you want to work out where you're wasting your time. [It also plays nice with Ulysses](http://blog.ulyssesapp.com/blog/2017/11/timing-ulysses/) for the writers out there.
