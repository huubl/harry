Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Building a responsive card system

[Building a responsive card system](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell/building-a-responsive-card-system-d98f93794e1a) was originally intended as an internal document to guide our dev team, but I decided to share the process on Medium as I figured it could be helpful for others. If you work with component libraries, your interested in rapid prototyping or good old Grid and Flexbox, then have a read, you might find it helpful.

## Flawless Typography Checklist

I took the plunge and bought [Typewolf's Flawless Typography Checklist](https://www.typewolf.com/checklist). Be warned, it's not cheap at $399 ($299 when I bought it on discount) but in my opinion, it's money well spent. Design is typography after all. When I consider the amount I've learnt, for free, from Typewolf over the years, then it's a no-brainer.

## The Difference Between Kerning and Tracking

[The difference between Kerning and Tracking in typography](http://csskarma.com/blog/typography-kerning-tracking/) by Tim Wright is a great little refresher on some of the intricacies of type.

## Typography tool: Archetype

[Archetype](https://archetypeapp.com/) looks like a promising tool for creating consistent web type. Check out [the intro demo](https://youtu.be/lN-O-JonhDI). The app uses modular scale to handle sizing and baseline grids for vertical rhythm. Your work can then be exported as CSS.

## The End of the F\*\*\*ing World

Last night I started watching [The End of the F\*\*\*ing World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbiiik_T3Bo), a new-ish Netflix original. Highly adictive stuff. The episodes are 20min long, perfect for those of us with commitment issues. Burn through a few and see what you think.
