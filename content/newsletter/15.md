Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. Last week I made it down to the new [Harland Miller](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=harland+miller&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjeudfH24PWAhXCUlAKHe8DD48Q_AUICSgA&biw=1420&bih=776&dpr=2) exhibition [One Bar Electric Memoir](http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/harland_miller_masons_yard_2017/) at [White Cube, Mason’s Yard](http://whitecube.com/about/). For anyone unfamiliar with Miller’s work, he’s best know for painting [fictional book covers](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=One+Bar+Electric+Memoir&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY8Ifb24PWAhXRKVAKHeLUDtAQ_AUIDCgD&biw=1420&bih=776) — often with sardonically humorous titles — which explore the relationship between viewer, text and image. Fans of typography and painting, perhaps more specifically the likes of [Ed Rushca](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Ed+Ruscha&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjp7ouc3IPWAhUOmbQKHRgQDVYQ_AUICigB&biw=1420&bih=776) will approve.
2. A few weeks back I shared [a quote by stoic philosopher Seneca](http://us14.campaign-archive2.com/?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=5c61228b08). I believe it was [Ed](https://twitter.com/Ed_Stephens_1) who pointed me in the direction of this gem: [Stoicism explained through Connor McGreggor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1zyVGooNME). McGreggor’s philosophy and personality are clearly both key attributes to his success but perhaps a lesser known reason could be his training with [movement coach Ido Portal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWl_wmst2LY). Portal is another interesting guy who essentially practices movement in an array of forms. [Just Move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJDz7qHBGQg) is a documentary all about him and his philosophy.

3. [Grid systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/350962.Grid_Systems_in_Graphic_Design_Raster_Systeme_Fur_Die_Visuele_Gestaltung?from_search=truec) are a fundamental part of print design, but they often get over looked when designing for the web. To make a seemly tricky concept a breeze and find visual harmony in your design, here are the best resources I’ve found on the 8-Point Grid System:

Start with this [intro to the 8-point grid system](https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632), then read this [guide to the 8-pt grid](https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid). For Sketch users, here’s [an interesting sketch workflow](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/8-point-soft-grids-in-sketch-e8f1d5ca2cd4) which uses the system. I’d also suggest reading [setting type on the web to a baseline grid](https://alistapart.com/article/settingtypeontheweb) for a better understanding of how baseline grids work on the web.

4. Here is one of my all time favourite illustrators;[Quentin Blake drawing Willy Wonker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZJm6QXSOP4&list=PL-EnO2AUKtUZFMQTRQkz-tuCbbgYYT3C3).
5. For your ears: [Lance De Sardi – The Power of Suggestion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq4tsQr8oNQ) great track if you like melodic/progressive stuff. I discovered this one by using [the insanely smart Shazam web app](https://www.shazam.com/gb) whilst listening to [this mix on the Feelmybicep blog](http://www.feelmybicep.com/fmb-mixtape-83-big-strick/).
