Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. This week I’ve been working hard on [an HTML prototype for a new messaging system](http://www.harrycresswell.co.uk/client/ain/ain-messenger/); the latest new feature on the [AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/) platform. For certain projects I try to build out [hi-fidelity prototypes](https://uxmag.com/articles/hi-fi-prototyping), generally when there is a certain level of complexity to the UI. The process started with [a simple sketch](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell/status/893498494757076992), and then static mockups but as there was some tricky responsive stuff so it made sense to build it out in code.
2. Here’s a quote from Roman philosopher [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger): “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality”. 
   As referenced by [Tim Ferris](https://tim.blog/) in [a short talk on Stoicism](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_ferriss_why_you_should_define_your_fears_instead_of_your_goals#t-412610). I dug a bit further and found 10 Books to Read After Discovering Stoicism put together by Nat Eliason. For those new to the subject, [Letter’s from a Stoic](https://www.nateliason.com/lessons/letters-stoic-seneca/) is a great place to start.

3. One of my favourite doodlers [Frank Chimero](https://www.frankchimero.com/) has launched [an awesome little shop](https://aokshop.co/). Go check it out, it will appeal to the child inside.
4. For your ears: [Bicep - Glue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZapePrpX64). Taken from their debut album released by the good folk at Ninja Tune.
