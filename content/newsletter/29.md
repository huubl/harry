Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Getting started with CSS Grid

[Learn CSS Grid in 5 minutes](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-css-grid-in-5-minutes-f582e87b1228) and [How to prototype websites quickly with CSS Grid](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-prototype-websites-quickly-with-css-grid-ffc9cba08583), both from [Per Harald Borgen](https://twitter.com/perborgen), have been valuable reads this week. Per has also released [a free video course on CSS Grid](https://scrimba.com/p/pRB9Hw/c2gd3T2), recorded on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), the awesome new interactive video format for code, which allows you to edit content directly in the video.

[Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/) by CSS Grid expert [Rachael Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/) is another very helpful collection of video tutorials, examples and patterns on the subject.

Grid is now [supported by all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=css%20grid) so now is the time to start using it if you're not already.

## UI Design Tips

Follow [Steve Schoger on twitter](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) for a steady supply of [super useful UI design tips and tricks](https://mobile.twitter.com/i/moments/880688233641848832).

[Collect UI](http://collectui.com/designs) is a monster categorised collection of UI designs which I've found useful lately. [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots) being my other usual go-to.

## Surprising habits of original thinkers

“The greatest originals are the ones who fail the most, because they’re the ones who try the most, you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones”, says organisational psychologist Adam Grant.

His Ted talk [the surprising habits of original thinkers](https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers#t-658709) looks at taking action on your ideas and embracing failure.

“Doubt the default and look for a better option” is another great quote I’ll be stealing.

Thank you to [Beanie](https://www.instagram.com/beaniemajor/) for reminding me of this one.

## The Farthest: Voyager's Interstellar Journey

Last weekend I watched BBC documentary [The Farthest: Voyager’s Interstellar Journey](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09gvnty/storyville-the-farthest-voyagers-interstellar-journey). The twin Voyager space probes–launched in 1977–still beam data back to earth from Interstellar space and will continue on their journey long after the earth has gone. These probes were responsible for the first pictures of our neighbouring planets and contain computers each with [69.63 kilobytes of memory](https://www.wired.com/2013/09/vintage-voyager-probes/). That’s about enough to store one average internet jpeg file. Honestly, it blows my mind thinking about it.

## Voyager 1 Golden Record

For your ears: This week it has to be the [Voyager 1 Golden Record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhuq9rNO_FQ&list=PLA5Z0m2JKyVJUgkMG08WP8KsAvLrjfkjP&index=1). The one and only time capsule for humanity and undoubtably the most precious cargo aboard. [Intended to portray the diversity of life and culture on earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record) to any intelligent extraterrestrial life who might find it. The capsule carries a stylus and visual instructions on how to play the record.
