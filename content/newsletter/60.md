Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Thought provoking

[Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html) by Nathaniel Rich.

Whilst scrolling through [this thread on approaches to learning](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/making-time-to-learn-what-is-your-approach-f18e24c041) I found this beauty: [On the Dangers of Potential Energy](http://kanonical.io/potential-energy/) from Greg Olsen. In Greg’s words; “...if you’re focused on doing stuff 80% of the time, you’ve got it.”

## Design and Code

Sara Soueidan’s [On Switching from HEX & RGB to HSL](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/hex-rgb-to-hsl/) covers some of the benefits of working with HSL including easier color harmonies and theming.

Chris Coyier prototypes an awesome [Sticky, Smooth, Active Nav](https://css-tricks.com/sticky-smooth-active-nav/), great for documentation sites, guides and the like.

[UI Sources](https://www.uisources.com/) is a growing collection of real product insights from the best designed and top grossing apps.

## Typography

“Blending traditional nuances found in original grotesque wood type with the contemporary feel of International Typographic Style, PM Grotesk acts as a modest alternative to its 21st Century peers.” [PM Grotesk](http://pmgrotesk.co.uk/) by [12B](http://12b.co.uk/).

Font in the wild: [Tiempos Headline](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-headline/) from Klim, seen here on [Malven](https://malven.co/).

[Perfecter](https://github.com/Volorf/Perfecter): a Sketch plugin to help you improve your type with modular scales.

Here’s a PDF copy of [Tim Brown’s Combining Typefaces](https://typekit.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/combiningtypefaces.pdf).

## Something to watch

[Aphex Twin - T69 Collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=92&v=SqayDnQ2wmw) will not disappoint.
