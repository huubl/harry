Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. Collector Tom Strong spent over 50 years assembling an incredible 250-piece collection of Braun appliances, designed by the great [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design). Here's [an interview with Strong about his obsession](https://www.gq.com/story/dieter-rams-braun-collection-at-vitsoe-nyc) with industrial design’s great minimalist. [The Strong collection](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/voice/strong) is on display at [Vitsoe London](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/contact) until 6th October.
2. [How new font technologies will improve the web](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/09/new-font-technologies-improve-web/) takes a look at the rise of parametric fonts, or “responsive type” if you like. A good example is [Spectral](https://spectral.prototypo.io/); the first Google font turned parametric using [Prototypo](https://www.prototypo.io/).
3. This might be [the best colour palette generator](http://khroma.co/) out there. It uses a colour generator algorthim to create [an infinite scroll of colour combinations](http://khroma.co/generator/). First you have to [pick your 50 favourite colours](http://khroma.co/train/) in order to start “training” the software.

4. [Up your kerning game with this cool tool](http://type.method.ac/) by [Method of Action](http://method.ac/).
5. For your ears: [Charlotte Gainsbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Gainsbourg) directs and stars in the video for her new song [Deadly Valentine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyIVKbCfG8) alongside musician [Dev Hynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev_Hynes). The video “portraying romantic rites of passage with a dark twist”. I've had it on repeat. [Her upcoming album “Rest”](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/charlotte-gainsbourg-rest/) will no doubt be a big hit. The album is produced by Ed Banger Records' [SebastiAn](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_(French_musician)>) and features [Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy-Manuel_de_Homem-Christo) of [Daft Punk](https://www.daftpunk.com/).
