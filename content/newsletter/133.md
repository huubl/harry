## Typography

[Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) is a new way of thinking about fluid responsive design. In particular, how to handle fluid type scales with CSS only, by using CSS custom properties, CSS locks and the concept of _hills._ Trys Mudford and James Gilyead are doing some great work on this project. They’ve written some brilliant articles – [Css-only fluid modular type scales](https://utopia.fyi/blog/css-modular-scales/) is one, but I urge you to read them all – and built both [a fluid type scale calculator](https://utopia.fyi/calculator/) and a [CSS generator](https://utopia.fyi/generator?c=320,21,1.2,1140,24,1.25,5,2,).

[Variablefonts.io](https://variablefonts.io/). Jason Pamental, Matthew Rechs, Caren Litherland, and the Google Fonts team launch a fantastic new website introducing variable fonts—what they are, what they can do, and why they matter.

I’m a big fan of [Fabrikat Normal](https://www.hvdfonts.com/fonts/fabrikat-normal), it’s beautiful, works great at small sizes and it’s very affordable. Christoph Koeberlin has made [a few updates](https://twitter.com/koeberlin/status/1237742390523412482?s=12) and it’s now available as a variable font.
