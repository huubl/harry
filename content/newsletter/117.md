Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #117, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## News (from me)

Lately I‘ve been thinking about how to simplify my life and my work. I’ve been juggling various different projects and – whether dealing with faulty internet or broken project dependencies – it feels like I’m spending more time fixing things than actually getting stuff done.

I was reminded of Frank Chimero’s seminal article [Everything easy is hard again](https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/) in which he poses “...the easiest and cheapest strategy for dealing with complexity is not to invent something to manage it, but to avoid the complexity altogether with a more clever plan.”

With this in mind, I’ve begun to simplify my convoluted workflow by building new starter projects for both [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/). I’m mid way through writing up the process and I hope to share both with you soon. My aim of course is to get back to basics by removing as much of the complexity and external dependencies as possible. Work with the web instead of against it and remove the barriers which are preventing me from getting things done.

## Thought provoking

“Use the platform until you can’t, then augment what’s missing. And when you augment, do so with care because the responsibility of ensuring the security, accessibility, and performance that the platform tries to give you by default now falls entirely on you.“ In [Using the Platform](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2019-10-21-using-the-platform/) Tim Kadlec delineates the care and consideration required when building for the web.

“The chief enemy of good decisions is a lack of sufficient perspectives on a problem” Alain de Botton found in [The Great Mental Models](https://fs.blog/tgmm/) by Farnam Street.
