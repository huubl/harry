Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Shortcuts vs Smartcuts

[What we can learn from Shortcuts](https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_hulme_what_can_we_learn_from_shortcuts#t-424124), a short TED Talk by designer [Tom Hulme](https://twitter.com/thulme), on how empathy and observation can help you build products people really want. [Here are my notes](https://harrycresswell.com/reading/what-can-we-learn-from-shortcuts/) from the talk if you’re short on time.

For a different take on shortcuts, try [Smartcuts by Shane Snow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20910174-smartcuts) a great book on how lateral thinking leads to innovation. I picked this one up a few years back, [here are my notes](https://harrycresswell.com/reading/smartcuts/).

## Personal and business growth

I enjoyed reading [How Vince MingPu Shao transitioned from a graphic designer to front-end developer in 5 months](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/graphic-designer-to-front-end-developer-7be7bfd6a46c). If you’re making the switch or keen to improve your dev skills there’s a ton of useful tips and resources in this one.

[How Zapier helped GrowthLab increase revenue by $350,000](https://growthlab.com/how-zapier-helped-us-increase-revenue-by-350000/) is well worth reading for tips on how automation tool [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/integrations) can help you grow your business.

## Graphics and Type

[Paul Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand) updated the [IBM Graphic Standards Manual](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/paul-rand-ibm-graphic-standards-manual-empire-editions-publication-graphic-design-180418) numerous times over a 20 year period, according to Sacha Léopold and François Havegeer of [Empire Editions](http://www.e-m-p-i-r-e.eu/). Rand clearly understand the importance of a living design system.

[Kris Sowersby on Geograph](https://klim.co.nz/blog/geograph-design-information/), a contemporary, plain sans serif designed for National Geographic, comprising 24 styles for use across their broadcast, print and web channels

## A short film by Albion

[Heading North](https://www.albioncycling.com/2017/11/watch-heading-north) is a short film from cycling brand [Albion](https://www.albioncycling.com/) which tells the story of one man’s attempt to ride over 650 kilometres from London to Edinburgh in 24 hours. A while back [Luke and I](https://harrycresswell.com/how/#how-i-work) designed and built their website, a custom Wordpress with Shopify integrated.

## For your ears

The [Heading North soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/3vkRpCxtpdPAkN37i2NIpg?si=PCk14mA5T6i94DbJ5raqqA), an original score composed for the film by James Wilson, and the first release on his new [Boxwork Music](http://boxworkmusic.com/) label.
