Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## CSS Documentation Best Practices

I enjoyed reading these [8 Best Practices for Perfect CSS Documentation](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/css-documentation-best-practices--cms-30139) this week. Writing good CSS is hard, working with inherited CSS is even harder, especially when the documentation sucks.

## Gestalt principles

“Gestalt (form, shape in German) is a group of visual perception principles developed by German psychologists in 1920s. It is built on the theory that ‘an organized whole, is perceived as greater than the sum of its parts’.”

[Gestalt principles in UI design](https://medium.muz.li/gestalt-principles-in-ui-design-6b75a41e9965) is a great read on how to use a bit of design theory to improve the user experiences you design.

For more on this stuff I highly recommend checking out [The Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/). It’s a collection of the maxims and principles that designers can consider when building user interfaces designed by [Jon Yablonski](https://jonyablonski.com/). He’s built a bunch of other cool things too, including [Swiss in CSS](https://swissincss.com/).

## Mailchimp’s content style guide

The [Mailchimp Content Style Guide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/) is an awesome resource for anyone regularly working with copy. Also worth looking at is their [Voice and Tone](http://voiceandtone.com/) guide. What they make most clear is the importance of putting the reader first.

For more on writing content, I read a book a while back called [Everybody Writes by Ann Handley](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00LMB5P0G/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_ocmOybEYGNVTZ) which is well worth reading. Here are [my notes and Kindle highlights from the book](https://www.harrycresswell.com/reading/everybody-writes/) if you’d rather not buy it.

## More on Variable Fonts

I talk about Variable fonts a lot, but for good reasons, they’re going to be big. A few days ago listened to [Shop Talk: Variable Fonts with Jason Pamental](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/296-variable-fonts-jason-pamental/) which is a great introduction on the technology.

To get going with variable fonts in your projects definitely read [One File, Many Options: Using Variable Fonts on the Web](https://css-tricks.com/one-file-many-options-using-variable-fonts-web/) and also [How to use variable fonts in the real world](https://medium.com/clear-left-thinking/how-to-use-variable-fonts-in-the-real-world-e6d73065a604). Both articles are super helpful.

## For your ears
