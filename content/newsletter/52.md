Hi folks,

After a couple of weeks shooting pictures in NYC for In Detail, I’m now back at my desk with a few useful links from around the internet.

## Notes on design

Arun Venkatesan on [Rediscovering Apple's 1987 Identity Guidelines](http://www.arun.is/blog/apple-guidelines/).

I enjoyed reading about [How Frank Chimero designs a poster](https://www.milanote.com/the-work/how-frank-chimero-designs-a-poster).

A well written [User Experience Research Field Guide](https://uxrfieldguide.com/) by Quintin Carlson.

[Codepen Design Patterns](https://codepen.io/patterns%20) is a super helpful compilation of familar front end design patterns.

## Notes on typography

[8-Point Grid: Typography On The Web](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/8-point-grid-typography-on-the-web-be5dc97db6bc), the latest instalment in Elliot Dahl’s series on designing with the infamous 8pt Grid.

Take the 2018 [Font Purchasing Habits Survey](http://fontpurchasinghabits.com/) to share your font preferences and purchasing habits.

In his latest book [Flexible Typesetting](https://abookapart.com/products/flexible-typesetting) Tim Brown illuminates the complex, beautiful world of typesetting.

Oliver Schöndorfer on [How to start with variable fonts on the web](https://www.zeichenschatz.net/typografie/how-to-start-with-variable-fonts-on-the-web.html). Fantastic intro to this relatively new font technology

## For your ears

This week we lost American rapper, singer and songwriter [Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy a.k.a XXXTentacion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXXTentacion). He was 20 years old. Here is [his break through album - 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAucVNRx_mU&index=2&list=PLwjYFBdI3ptjLZblzjDrYh_5Bz0lch0R7).
