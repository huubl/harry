Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [Hato co-designed a typeface with 45 selected artists](https://hato.co/casestudy/10), providing them with a digital tool with which they could create unique letterforms and alphabets. The aggregated data was used to inform the final typeface.

“Our projects focus on giving people the tools to collaborate and express their ideas through design”

2. We used a collaborative approach when designing [the BrickTribe identity](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/boards/5333334). The logo and wordmark were essentially [designed during a team meeting](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell/status/928914240953602048), where everyone at [AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/) had an equal input in the final outcome. You might remember a previous Hato project which takes the approach a step further by collaborating with the public: [Crowdsourcing the 2016 Pick Me Up Festival identity.](https://hato.co/casestudy/3).

3. [Redesigning social platforms for better mental health](http://www.studio-output.com/case_study/studio-project-1/)—an experimental research study by [Studio Output](http://www.studio-output.com/) exploring [the effects of social media on mental health](http://course.duruofei.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Choudhury_Predicting-Depression-via-Social-Media_ICWSM13).

4. [Value of Multi Typeface design](https://blog.prototypr.io/the-value-of-multi-typeface-design-ccd67227b0ee) outlines [Bethany Heck](http://fontreviewjournal.com/) approach to using any number of typefaces in a design. Something often considered bad practice.

5. Earlier this week I woke up, played [Luther Vandross - Never Too Much](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNj9bXKGOiI) and [laughed at myself in the mirror](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/why-science-good-health-favors-those-who-can-laugh-themselves-ncna781256). Try it some time.
