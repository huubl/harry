Hi folks,

A few links I felt were worth sharing this week...

## Thought provoking

[How to Make Your Future Habits Easy](https://jamesclear.com/reset-the-room) taken from Atomic Habits by James Clear. Make this your next book, it’s a real gem.

“Be humble. Don’t think or act like you are special or better than anyone else (even if you actually are).” [The Scandinavian rule that every designer should follow](https://uxdesign.cc/the-scandinavian-rule-that-designers-need-to-follow-3fbce5e80330) from Ahmed H. Aly.

## Design and Code

Stephen Lindberg on [Concise Media Queries with CSS Grid](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/concise-media-queries-with-css-grid).

[How I Do Web Development from my iPad Pro Full Time](https://curtismchale.ca/2018/10/23/how-i-do-web-development-from-my-ipad-pro-full-time/) from Curtis McHale. Having spent a few hours this week trying to figure out web development on a Chromebook, I know first hand how useful an article like this is.

## Typography

[The face of Design Switzerland](https://www.basedesign.com/work/swiss-arts-council-pro-helvetia-design-switzerland), a quirky monospace font, designed for Pro Helvetia by Base Design and Ian Party of Swiss Typefaces.

Meet [Banana Grotesk](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/cheeky-anonymous-foundry-monkey-type-releases-its-ap-peel-ing-font-banana-grotesk/), the first offering from [Monkey Type](http://monkeytype.xyz/). The font is “based on an attempt to sketch Akzidenz Grotesk from memory, with some interesting characteristics of Gill Facia thrown into the mix”.

## Something to watch

[Why beautiful things make us happy - beauty explained](https://youtu.be/-O5kNPlUV7w). Latest collab between [Sagmeister & Walsh](https://sagmeisterwalsh.com/) and [Kurzgesagt](https://kurzgesagt.org/). Oh and don’t forget to grab your [12,019 Human Era Calendar](https://standard.tv/collections/in-a-nutshell/products/in-a-nutshell-12-019-human-era-calendar).
