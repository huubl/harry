Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #118, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

This week we have two quotes worthy of reflection, an interesting read on colour and tutorials on dark mode and semantic form styling. Also Sir Tim Berners-Lee talks about his aspirations for the future of the World Wide Web.

## Thought provoking

“Always make a definition or sketch of what presents itself to your mind, so you can see it stripped bare to its essential nature and identify it clearly, in whole and in all its parts, and can tell yourself its proper name and the names of those elements of which it is compounded and into which it will be dissolved.” Marcus Aurelius in [Meditations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations).

“The most interesting people are the ones who don’t avoid reality. The people who are honest both with themselves and with others. These people have mastered something many of us have yet to learn: They have accepted their reality and then embraced it. They lean in.” Tobias Van Schneider in [Lean In](https://www.vanschneider.com/lean-in).
