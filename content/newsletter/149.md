Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #149, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

”The small delights and touches, the little a-ha moments, make me STAY. I wander around the site, exploring, learning, feeling actually more connected to each of these humans rather than as if I’m glancing at a PDF of their resume.” [In Defense of a Fussy Website](https://css-tricks.com/in-defense-of-a-fussy-website/) from Sarah Drasner.

“Creating with compassion in an environment fueled by compassion means we never lose sight of what it’s all about: people.” [Connecting the dots](https://alistapart.com/article/creative-culture-excerpt/). In this excerpt from Creative Culture, Justin Dauer draws direct connections between an organizations’ true culture and the design work that it does.

## Design and Code

[Irregular-shaped Links with Subgrid](https://css-irl.info/irregular-shaped-links-with-subgrid). What if our link hover effect needs to affect a number of child items, and they don’t all sit neatly inside a rectangle, like a regular card? Michelle Barker has the answers.

[When Sass and New CSS Features Collide](https://css-tricks.com/when-sass-and-new-css-features-collide/) from Ana Tudor. “The trick here is to remember that Sass is case-sensitive, but CSS isn’t. That means we can write `Min(20em, 50vh)` and Sass won’t recognize it as its own `min()` function. No errors will be thrown and it’s still valid CSS that works as intended.“

[Fun with Forms](https://funwithforms.com/) is a new project from Michael Scharnagl, where he explores HTML forms. Expect to learn a few new things starting with [The form attribute](https://funwithforms.com/posts/form-attribute/).

[Designing beautiful focus states](https://thegymnasium.com/take5/designing-beautiful-focus-states). A short video tutorial by Ethan Marcotte — the fellow who started that whole “responsive design” thing.

## Typography

[A Legacy in Letters with Erik Spiekermann](https://gestalten.com/blogs/journal/a-legacy-in-letters-with-erik-spiekermann). A toast to a master of graphic design and typography on his birthday from publisher gestalten.

[Forever Grotesque](https://www.nouvellenoire.ch/product/forever-grotesk/) is a new release from Nouvelle Noire designer Anton Studer which celebrates a desire to keep just a tiny bit of the spirit of the original meaning “Grotesque” alive. Available in 14 styles including a Fat weight.

[Certain Magazine’s Top 15 Type-Focused Artists](http://type-01.com/guest-spot-certain-magazines-top-15-type-focused-artists/) on Type 01.

## Something to watch

[The details of UI typography](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10175/). Loïc Sander and Jiang Jiang from the Apple design team show you how to achieve exceptional typography in your app's user interface that enhances legibility, accessibility, and consistency.
