Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [Before you can be with others first learn to be alone](https://aeon.co/ideas/before-you-can-be-with-others-first-learn-to-be-alone) — A quick but thought provoking read on the importance of finding solitude

2. Here is typographer and artist [Cyrus Highsmith talking about type design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_0dTuXr3R0). I love his unique approach to drawing letter forms, particularly how he chooses to focus on the white space surrounding letters, opposed to the glyphs themselves. [Cyrus’ blog](http://cyrushighsmith.tumblr.com/) is a great source of inspiration if you’re interested in drawing and unconventional typography. I’m also enjoying [his approach to making sketchbooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Hs3qJ3hJM&t=16s).

3. You’re probably already familiar with free stock image sites such as Unsplash or Pexels. [A lesser known source of stock images and design resources](https://www.rawpixel.com/category/53/public-domain) I like to use is [public domain artwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Public_domain_art). This is work accessible to the public, where the copyright has expired. It’s free to use for an purpose, without the need to credit or ask permission. Google spits out an endless supply of it. Give it a go.

4. Here’s a quote by [Adam Morse](https://twitter.com/mrmrs_) I found via that marvel article I shared last week:

“Design is just problem solving within a set of constraints. In the grand scheme of things, it rarely has anything to do with graphics.”

I often find by working within constraints, and purposely limiting my choices, I design far better products. To give you a quick example, if you’re working with colour, try limiting your palette to 2 colours instead of 4. Simple stuff, but even the smallest limitations can produce effective results.

5. For your ears: [Nickodemus - Mistery of Life (feat Andrea Montiero)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZ1rsSrq5Q) Another one I found purely by accident.
