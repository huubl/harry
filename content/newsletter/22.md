Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. “It had to be more legible, visually distinctive and save money”. David Bailey,

Creative Director of UX and Design at the BBC discusses [the requirements of launching BBC Reid](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/nicer-tuesday-september-2017-david-bailey-bbc-reith-191017), the custom type family designed to replace Gill Sans and Helvetica. The [typography guidelines](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/typography) on the BBC's [Global Visual Language site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/typography) are worth a look.

2. This week I've updating the design system we use at [AIN](https://www.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/). I wrote a quick article about the process: [Using Sketch Libraries to build a better design system](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell/using-sketch-libraries-to-build-a-better-ui-design-system-part-1-26f5660f3c98).
3. If [naming things in CSS grid layout](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/naming-things-css-grid-layout/) is new to you then I highly recommend reading [The New CSS Layout](https://abookapart.com/products/the-new-css-layout) written by [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/).
4. Everything [Richard Rutter](http://clagnut.com/) knows about [typesetting numerals on screen](https://alistapart.com/article/web-typography-numerals). Taken from his book [Web Typography](http://book.webtypography.net/).
5. For your ears: [New Energy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWInZ4N6C2g) is the 9th studio album by Kieran Hebden otherwise known as [Four Tet](http://www.fourtet.net/).
