Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #154, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“When you write every day, you’ll start to think constantly about what to write about. And what is even more valuable: You start to notice things, thoughts, and connections throughout the day that might be an interesting topic for a post.”

[Halftime](https://matthiasott.com/notes/halftime). Matthias Ott reflects on the first 50 posts of his 100-days-of-writing challenge.

[Tailwind CSS: From Side-Project Byproduct to Multi-Million Dollar Business](https://adamwathan.me/tailwindcss-from-side-project-byproduct-to-multi-mullion-dollar-business/). As Tailwind hits 10 million total installs and $2M in revenue, Adam Wathan tells the story so far.

## Design and Code

[What does 100% mean in CSS?](https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-percents). Amelia Wattenberger creates some lovely interactive examples to help explain what the CSS percent unit actually does.

[The Making of: Netlify’s Million Devs SVG Animation Site](https://css-tricks.com/the-making-of-netlifys-million-devs-svg-animation-site/). Sarah Drasner captures the process of building the Million Developers microsite for Netlify, focusing mainly on the animation aspects.

[To Design a More Accessible Internet, Consider the “Creative Layer” of Metadata](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/to-design-a-more-accessible-internet-consider-the-creative-layer-of-metadata/) from Margaret Rhodes. Using alt-text thoughtfully is the exception, not the rule.

[Optimizing CSS for faster page loads](https://pustelto.com/blog/optimizing-css-for-faster-page-loads/). Tomas Pustelnik shares some great techniques for improving page performance, such as lazy loading stylesheets, inlining critical CSS and code splitting.

[Simplified Development Workflow](https://jonyablonski.com/articles/2020/simplified-development-workflow/). Staying focused on what matters by reducing dependencies and decisions. Jon Yablonski runs through some of the awesome features of Hugo which can help you keep your workflow simple.

## Typography

Anna Monus on [How to Self-Host Google Fonts on Your Own Server](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-self-host-google-fonts--cms-34775). Even though self-hosting Google Fonts might seem easy and self-explanatory at first, there are loads of things to pay attention to if you want to keep performance in mind.

[Pangram Pangram’s New Typeface Inspired by Natural Motions and Bird Migrations](http://type-01.com/pangram-pangrams-new-typeface-inspired-by-natural-motions-and-bird-migrations/) from Zoe Loring Murphy. Migra is a spiky serif filled with movement and rhythm. As the foundry describes, ‘its weights span from an austere and elegant light cut to a hawkish and powerful black one’, and the gracious treatment of its bird-like features creates a palpable sense of movement and character.

[Haste from DSType Foundry](https://twitter.com/Fontstand/status/1288491449559003141?s=20) is a typeface that questions conventional classification. Is it a high or a low contrast typeface? Is it a Sans or a Slab? Normal or reversed-contrast?

## Something to watch

[Create a Plugin for 11ty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO-NFFKjnnE). In this episode of Learn With Jason, Bryan Robinson teaches us how to take 11ty even further with custom plugins.
