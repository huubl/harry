Hi Folks,

Here’s this weeks hoard of interesting links from around the internet...

## Thought provoking

[Forget about setting goals. Focus on this instead](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems) by James Clear.

[Web Design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/) from Jeremy Thomas.

## Design and Code

[Native image lazy-loading for the web!](https://addyosmani.com/blog/lazy-loading/) Addy Osmani on the new loading attribute for native <img> and <iframe> lazy-loading.

Stephanie Walter on [Color accessibility: tools and resources to help you design inclusive products](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/color-accessibility-tools-resources-to-design-inclusive-products/).

[Creating a full bleed utility](https://andy-bell.design/wrote/creating-a-full-bleed-css-utility/) from Andy Bell.

This year nearly 90,000 developers told Stackoverflow how they learn and level up, which tools they’re using, and what they want.Here’s the [2019 Developer Survey Results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019).

## Typography

[Helvetica Now](https://www.monotype.com/fonts/helvetica-now/) – A complete re-draw of perhaps the best-known typeface of all time. Available in three optical sizes—Micro, Text, and Display. As Erik Spiekermann puts it; “this is the typeface Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann would have designed back in 1957 if they had known about offset printing, small screens, browsers, digital design tools and UI designers.”

[Long-form websites and typography](https://lawler.io/scrivings/long-form-websites-and-typography/). Interesting onservations from Eric Lawler.

Billy Whited on [Setting Type for User Interfaces](https://theblog.adobe.com/setting-type-for-user-interfaces/).

## Something to watch

I’ve been watching Darren Aronofsky’s [One Strange Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1ZPG1CEUJE), a Netflix series about what makes Earth unique and able to support life. The story is told through the unique perspective of astronauts who have spent time aboard the International Space Station, 200 miles above Earth, and observed first hand the interconnected planetary system that keep us alive. Highly recommended viewing.
