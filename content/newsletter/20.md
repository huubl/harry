Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [Dropbox unveil a complete rebrand](https://www.dropbox.com/), the biggest change to the companies visual identity in it’s 10 year history. According to [a post by the design team](https://dropbox.design/) who collaborated with [design studio Collins](https://www.wearecollins.com/work/dropbox/) on the project, the rebrand injects [creative energy](https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/10/creative-energy-keep-it-flowing/) into “a living workspace that brings teams and ideas together”. Collins chose to completely revamp both typography and wordmark, adopting the multi-width workhorse [Sharp Grotesque](https://sharptype.co/typefaces/sharp-grotesk/) for its “versatility” and sheer range of 259 fonts. The logo also has a fresh new look, and sits along side a flexible new system for both colour and [illustration](https://www.dropbox.com/about).
2. [Typography is Impossible](https://medium.engineering/typography-is-impossible-5872b0c7f891) says Marcin Wichary. This awesome [5 minute guide to better type](http://pierrickcalvez.com/journal/a-five-minutes-guide-to-better-typography) might well make it less so. Failing that, grab a copy of [The Elements of Typographic Style](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063), as [Hermann Zapf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Zapf) initially proposed—“the typographers’ Bible.”
3. “The in-between stage of being young yet no longer so young is a complex phase.” [Inside the Head](https://insidethehead.co/chapters#age) is “an homage to this fascinating transitional period”.

4. Ryan Gosling in an [SNL skit about Papyrus](https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/gkuk69n5ku5hlxrn7/zvtghn/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1qVmhsSk5Kb3BPUQ==). Possibly the most emotional objection I seen towards a controversial typeface.
5. I collab-ed with my old friends [Dark Sky](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/darksky) again, this time on [a t-shirt for Carhartt](https://www.monkeytownrecords.com/products/view/413/dark-sky-othona-t-shirt) featuring the Othona album cover art and logo. After having their [studio robbed and all their music stolen](https://www.facebook.com/darkskyuk/posts/1728474270498855), they’ve miraculously bounced back with [“Lossless”—a new album made up of salvaged material](https://open.spotify.com/album/4BSZVMidtxIz2zkjAKfkT9). They’re giving it away for [free](https://dark-sky.bandcamp.com/) to thank everyone for their support whilst they get back on their feet.
