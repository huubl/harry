Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [A fascinating post](https://medium.com/the-mission/here-with-2-years-of-exhausting-photographic-detail-is-how-to-write-a-book-fda1a6b40802) by Ryan Holiday, detailing the process of writing his latest book [Perennial Seller: The Art of Making and Marketing Work that Lasts](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0143109014/wwwaustinkleo-20/ref=nosim/). Super insightful and informative. This one got me thinking; the fundamentals of any creative process are essentially the same. Be it writing a book, designing a typeface or something else, there’s always some form of ideation, research, execution and revision. You don’t have to be writing a book to take something from Ryan’s process.

2. [Yukai Du talks through her painstaking process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6LztKaNm_c) of tuning a written script into a story body of illustrations and a short animated film. For more along these lines, here’s [Malika Favre talking about her process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPGABk4d9NA), which she used to create a series of work based on a trip to Fuerteventura. Both talks are taken from [Nicer Tuesdays,](http://www.itsnicethat.com/nicer-tuesdays) a speaking event held by the folks behind [It’s Nice that](http://www.itsnicethat.com/).

3. Some days the procrastination is bad. Last Friday was a particularly rough one, saved only by a copy of [Eat that Frog](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/cka/Eat-That-Frog-More-Important-Things-Today/1444765426), which was coincidentally handed to me that evening. It’s a great little book by [Brian Tracy](http://www.briantracy.com/) on beating procrastination and getting things done. A quick read packed full of useful tips.

4. Digging the work of [Raymond Savignac](https://www.google.de/search?q=Raymond+Savignac&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1hdTEh6zVAhWPaFAKHaAnBgkQ_AUICigB&biw=1156&bih=730#imgrc=AeT5OKAPqd3wDM:). I’ve got a real thing for classic graphic posters and early design at the moment.

5. For your ears: Here’s an hour of [Solomun x Âme x Moderat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfIZErx14Sg&t=833s). It’s quite heavy going, but playing it on low volume in the background has really helped my concentration this week.
