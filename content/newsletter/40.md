Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Onboarding and automation

I’ve been doing a fair amount of work on setting up client onboarding and automation sequences this week, for my own site and In Detail. [Paul Jarvis](https://pjrvs.com/onboarding/) has done a lot of work on this stuff which has been very helpful.

If this sounds interesting to you the I recommend listening to [Paul talking to Brian Clark about onboarding on the Unemployable podcast](https://unemployable.com/podcast/onboard-new-clients/). Then read [Paul’s onboarding article](https://pjrvs.com/onboarding/) and checkout [a few articles on his Chimpessentials course site](https://chimpessentials.com/client-onboarding-process-automation/).

I’m aiming to write few articles myself on specific sequences I’m using on my personal site in the near future.

## Illustration guidelines

Lately I began work on an Illustration System for AIN, so I’ve been researching the best way to go about it. I found some great articles by an illustrator called Al Power. [Creating an illustration guideline](https://medium.com/@alpower81/creating-an-illustration-guideline-57556a56dee2) is a good place to start.

A few other notable resources, the illustration section in the [Shopify Polaris design system](https://medium.com/@alpower81/creating-an-illustration-guideline-57556a56dee2) and [atlassian.design](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/marketing/foundations/illustrations). I also bookmarked a few site which make great use of illustration to sell their product; [Oscar](https://www.hioscar.com/individuals/ny), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/customers/) and [twist](https://twistapp.com/).

Beyond the obvious ones in Dribble and Behance, it turns out [Pinterest is an incredible rabbit hole for web illustration moodboarding](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/449867450269755229). The site has a very clever tagging system which seems to suggest very similar styles of image. I dug a bit deeper on this and found [the whitepaper on related pins at Pinterest](https://labs.pinterest.com/user/themes/pinlabs/assets/paper/p2p-www17.pdf). In case you feel like geeking out.

## Unsubscribing from email

With [Unroll.me selling our data](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/personal-data-firm-slice-unroll-me-backlash-uber.html) I’ve been on the hunt for a viable alternative for deal emails don’t make it easy to unsubscribe.

A good option seems like [Google unsubscriber](https://www.labnol.org/internet/gmail-unsubscribe/28806/), a simple google script which open source and doesn’t store any of your data.

[Unsubscriber](https://getunsubscriber.com/) is another though it doesn’t offer a rollup feature and may well or may not be selling your data. [Follow this link](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) if you want to know who currently has access to your gmail account.

On a separate but related note; here’s a good article on [unsubscribe UX](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/unsubscribe-ux/) and another on [the UX of creatively effective unsubscribe pages](https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/8-creatively-effective-unsubscribe-pages-you-should-take-notes-from).

## For your ears

[This tweet from Dan Eden](https://twitter.com/_dte/status/971469769898512384) reminded me of a good track for chilling: [Bibio - Mind Bokeh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oFuW3KBtJs)

P.S — I finally got round to re-designing [my personal site](https://harrycresswell.com/). It’s a bit rough round the edges but it feels like an improvement.
