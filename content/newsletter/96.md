Hey everyone,

Here’s this weeks roundup of what’s new in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

We all share and use the web, just as we all share and live on this planet. [The Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/) is a public declaration of a shared commitment to create a sustainable internet.

[The first draft of anything is shit](https://www.writingroutines.com/the-first-draft-of-anything-is-shit/) from Writing Routines.

## Design and Code

[Learn git concepts, not commands](https://dev.to/unseenwizzard/learn-git-concepts-not-commands-4gjc). An interactive git tutorial by Nico Riedmann, meant to teach you how git works, not just which commands to execute.

## Typography

## Something to watch
