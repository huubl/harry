Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #122, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography. This will be the last one from me for 2019, so before we get going I’d like to thank you for all your support this year, it’s been a great year and I wish you all a very happy holiday.

## Thought provoking

["The Decade of Design”: How the last 10 years transformed design’s role](https://www.figma.com/blog/the-rise-of-ux-ui-design-a-decade-in-reflection/). Carmel DeAmicis on how designers were called to action as mobile upended the way products were built.

“A design system is about people: how they interact, how they understand one another, and how they work together to achieve a common goal.” In [Where We Can Go](https://daneden.me/2019/08/27/where-we-can-go/) Dan Eden explores how tooling can help make better bridges between the people involved in building products.

“When you think about consistency, you’re thinking about the product. When you’re thinking about current knowledge, you’re thinking about the user.” Jared M. Spool in [Consistency in Design is the Wrong Approach](https://articles.uie.com/consistency-in-design-is-the-wrong-approach/).

## Design and Code

“As soon as you release a design system, people will ask you how to deviate from it, and you’ll want to be armed with persuasive answers.” Yesenia Perez-Cruz on [Making Room for Variation](https://alistapart.com/article/making-room-for-variation/).

[The 2019 State of JavaScript Survey](https://2019.stateofjs.com/) results are now available and include some really impressive data visualisations built by Amelia Wattenberger using D3.js.

“With little to differentiate their designs, products and websites have adopted a regrettable uniformity which makes it difficult to distinguish between them.” Andy Clarke in [Z’s Still Not Dead Baby, Z’s Still Not Dead](https://24ways.org/2019/zs-still-not-dead-baby-zs-still-not-dead/).

[<select> your poison](https://www.24a11y.com/2019/select-your-poison/). Sarah Higley on what happens when you try to remake the <select> element and why it’s so difficult to create a custom accessible select component.

Régis Philibert is back with [The Full Partial Series Part 2: Returning partials!](https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2019/12/hugo-partial-series-part-2-functions-with-returning-partials/) A series on some of the more advanced topics in Hugo.

[Beautiful scrolling experiences without libraries](https://24ways.org/2019/beautiful-scrolling-experiences-without-libraries/). Another great write up by Michelle Barker.

## Typography

“Just when you think you’ve seen it all, a typeface comes along that turns your expectations upside down.” Yves Peters reviews [Faune](https://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/faune/), a new type family by Alice Savoie inspired by the plurality of the animal world. [Download Faune for free](http://cnap.graphismeenfrance.fr/faune/en.html).

[Violet Sans](https://github.com/violetoffice/violet_sans). An open-source geometric san serif inspired by Eurostile and developed for modern applications with a bit of experimentation and haphazard gestures built right in.

[Giant Spirit](https://www.fontsmith.com/blog/2019/12/03/new-custom-script-font-for-tourism-northern-ireland-from-genesis-advertising-in-collaboration-artist-colin-davidson) is a custom script font for Tourism Northern Ireland from Genesis Advertising in collaboration artist Colin Davidson

## Something to watch

[Why are there Four Firefoxes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ1oQJJn1nQ&feature=youtu.be) Jen Simmons explains the difference between Firefox, Firefox Developer Edition and Firefox Nightly.
