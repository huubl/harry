Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week

## Design

I’ve been listening to the [Syntax Podcast](https://syntax.fm/) a lot lately. In [this episode](https://syntax.fm/show/056/design-systems) Scott and Wes talk design systems and share a ton of great resources.

One site mentioned in the show is [Design Systems Repo](https://designsystemsrepo.com/), a great new resource of everything design systems.

[How to build complicated grids using CSS grid](https://danwebb.co/journal/how-to-build-complicated-grids-using-css-grid), a superb article on some of the more challenging aspects of working with CSS Grid.

## Typography

[Type Detail](https://typedetail.com/georgia.html) is a project by [Wenting Zhang](https://twitter.com/designjokes), where a different web typeface is deconstructed and annotated each day.

Check out Wenting’s other project [Font Playground](https://play.typedetail.com/) which provides a testing environment for a growing selection of variable fonts.

Robin Rendle’s essay [The future of typography](https://robinrendle.com/essays/futures-of-typography/) is a valuable read for any keen typographer.

## Serverless

[Plasso Storefront](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/plasso-storefront), an awesome new e-commerce system without the code. Their other product [Flexkit](https://plasso.com/flexkit) allows you to fully customise your payment system. Both tools hit the #1 on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/plasso-storefront).

[Working with data in Hugo](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/data-hugo/), something I wrote for those of you building sites with Hugo. This tool becomes as powerful as any when you master data files.

## Something to watch

[Still Storch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-g0jxauBJg&app=desktop), a short documentary on the life and career of music producer-songwriter Scott Storch.
