Happy New Year!

I hope you’ve had a positive start to 2019.

As the majority of us have been busy celebrating thing other than design, code and typography, this issue will take a slightly different format.

Instead of the usual, I figured it would be a good chance to reflect on 2018 by sharing some my favourite year end reviews.

In no particular order:
