## Typography

[Signifier](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/signifier/), the latest release from Klim Type Foundry, is a Brutalist response to 17th century typefaces. Designed by Kris Sowersby, Signifier’s digital immateriality draws on a deeply material past. Acknowledging the processes and tools of digital form-making, Sowersby worked consciously with the computer to recast the lead, antimony, and tin of the 17th century Fell Types into ones and zeros. Signifier emerged from this alchemy with Bézier curves and sharp vectors determined by machine logic and a Brutalist ethos.
