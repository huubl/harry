Hey Folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. I’ve been following the work of [Oliver Jeffers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-8ydwV45no&t=4s) lately. He makes children’s picture books and paints pictures, but what makes him stand out more than anuthing is his story telling. I often forget how important it is to tell great stories, in life and at work. Humans have used storytelling as a way to connect with one another, and articulate ideas, since time began. It’s the most effective way to communicate, so let’s not forget it. For a bit more inspiration check out [Oliver's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oliverjeffers/). The amount of work he puts out is astounding.

2. For those interested in marketing, here’s [a great article](https://designschool.canva.com/blog/visual-marketing/) on why our brains respond best to anything visual.

3. Speaking of visual, one of my all time favourite moodboards is [Haw-lin](http://haw-lin.com/). There’s a lot of junk out there on the internet but this site is a rare gem that I’ve been coming back to for years. Fun fact: the name Haw-lin combines the two places which brought [the founders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOajSHv7M5I) together — Hawaii and Berlin. They now run a design and photography studio; [Haw-lin Services](http://haw-lin-services.com/)

4. [Sketching](https://trello.com/c/krE5oSUq/14-marketplace-affiliate-services-landing-page) is a big part of my design process. Often I won’t even take it to the computer until the idea has been signed off on paper. I love how quickly you can visualise concepts without being distracted by the fine details. Lately, I’ve been working on taking [sketchnotes during talks](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell/status/857886012294524928), mainly to improve my sketching but also to visualise what I’m learning. A great way to get going is to [pick a Ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action) and write down the important points in chunks. For more Sketchnoting techniques [this talk by Eva-Lotta Lamm](https://vimeo.com/181110884) is helpful.

5. For your ears: [Dark Sky - The Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HX88bAT0ZM). A track by two of my schoolmates, who I’ve worked with on pretty much [all their releases](https://soundcloud.com/harrycresswell) over the past few years. This one is taken from their new album “Othona” which is based on idea of community and belonging.
