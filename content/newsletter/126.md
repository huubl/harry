Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #126, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“Getting your words in the world is a crazy thing. I wish I could be in all the places my books have been…” [Books I wrote that I can’t read](https://austinkleon.com/2020/01/22/books-i-wrote-that-i-cant-read/\). A short note from Austin Kleon, which made me appreciate just how powerful writing can be.
