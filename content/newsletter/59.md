Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week

## Thought provoking

“An honest web is one in which the overwhelming majority of the code and assets downloaded to a user’s computer are used in a page’s visual presentation, with nearly all the remainder used to define the semantic structure and associated metadata on the page.

Bullshit — in the form of CPU-sucking surveillance, unnecessarily-interruptive elements, and behaviours that nobody responsible for a website would themselves find appealing as a visitor — is unwelcome and intolerable.”

## Design and Code

[Creating a consistent visual hook](https://heydesigner.com/blog/consistent-visual-hook/) is a valuable read for those of you working with startups.

[The Cost of Javascript](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4). JavaScript is still the most expensive resource we send to mobile phones, because it can delay interactivity in large ways. How much is JS costing you?

## Typography

[A new identity for Tumblr](https://medium.com/@thisisdougrichard/some-updates-to-tumblr-112876234c2d?source=linkShare-8c03963310f6-1533628033). Tumblr’s creative director Doug Richard shares insights into working with [Dinamo](https://www.abcdinamo.com/projects/tumblr) on a custom version of Favorit.

Fonts in the wild: [Bluu Next Bold from Open Foundry](http://open-foundry.com/hot30/bluu_next_bold), seen here on [Neue Goods](https://www.neuegoods.com/).

[Google Font Combinations](http://fonts.greatsimple.io/), a little site for when you’re stuck for ideas.

## Useful Tools

[Scale](https://hihayk.github.io/scale/) – a very handy tool for generating a color scale from Hihayk.

[StyleURL](https://www.styleurl.app/) – a cool Chrome extension which lets you make CSS changes on the fly and export them.
