Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #150, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“Materials and dimensionality has made its way back into the interface —and every single app icon for every application and utility that Apple ships with macOS has been redesigned with depth, textures and lighting. This is a big deal. Probably bigger than what most people realise.” Michael Flarup in [The Comeback of Fun in Visual Design](https://applypixels.com/blog/comeback).

“What blows me away most of all, is that the really good designers stand up to the misfortune of a killed idea. They take away the lesson of what went wrong, and come back with something that much stronger. Or, if not stronger, something different but equally good.” Jeffrey Zeldman in [Sticking To It](https://automattic.design/2020/07/09/sticking-to-it/).

## Design and Code
