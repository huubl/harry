Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #139, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

Building on the idea that learning worldly wisdom improves our decisions and our outcomes, and leads to a more meaningful life, [volume 2 of The Great Mental Models series](https://fs.blog/tgmm/) explains the foundational concepts of physics, chemistry, and biology, demonstrating the value of having these models in your toolkit.

[How can I use focus blocks and get others to respect heads-down time?](http://cameronmoll.com/journal/question-how-can-i-use-focus-blocks-and-heads-down-time) Cameron Moll shares some insight into using focus blocks to find a state of flow while working.

## Design and Code

”Not every problem requires a hammer. Part of being a good developer is being able to pick the right tool for the job. Being able to weigh a technology’s strengths against its weaknesses, and articulate them, are incredibly valuable skills.”

Eric Bailey wrote [How to not make a résumé in React](https://ericwbailey.design/writing/how-to-not-make-a-resume-in-react.html) in response to all the inaccessible React resumes doing the rounds. Then Max Böck created an [Eleventy Résumé Builder](https://mxb.dev/blog/eleventy-resume-builder/) in response to Eric’s article. Great stuff.

Ahmad Shadeed covers everything you need to know about [Spacing in CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/spacing-in-css/), the different ways of create it, and when to use a padding or margin.

## Typography

[Respira](https://sharptype.co/typefaces/respira-black/) is a contemporary blackletter inspired by Spanish and English models from the 15th and 16th centuries. From its release on Earth Day, 2017, all proceeds from the sale of the typeface will be donated to the NRDC.

[How to prepare and use variable fonts on the web](https://thetrevorharmon.com/blog/how-to-prepare-and-use-variable-fonts-on-the-web). A great primer from Trevor Harmon on variable font subsetting, formatting, and working with CSS font features. In the piece Trevor implements Inter by Rasmus Andersson.

“Solid typography can elevate the worst imagery.” [Nick Losacco talks to It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/nick-losacco-graphic-design-200420) about his type-focussed, minimal designs . If you’re not familiar with Nick’s work, I highly recommend checking out [his website](https://www.nicklosacco.com/), his typographic work is some of the best around.

“Typography can eloquently articulate an idea and colourfully communicate a message in ways which are as powerful as any illustration or photograph.” [Inspired Design Decisions With Herb Lubalin](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/inspired-design-decisions-herb-lubalin/) from Andy Clarke.
