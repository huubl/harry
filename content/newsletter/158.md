“When you see someone succeed, it's much more important to understand the context of their vision. Don't ask for the how. Understand their why. Go a step deeper. Ask why again. Understand their intention, and question their understanding.“ David Sherry in [Why do Intentions Matter?](https://www.caffeine.blog/why-do-intentions-matter/)

“A brand isn't a destination. It's a continuing process that evolves over time. So you've never made it, and you're always nurturing it forward.” David Sherry in [Personal Brand Heuristics](https://www.caffeine.blog/personal-brand-heuristics/).

## Typography

[Grotta](https://type-department.com/collections/sans-serif-fonts/products/grotta), is a font family created by Due Studio, is an irreverent, contemporary and neo-Grotesk typeface with strong geometric accents and sharp contrasts in its form. Characterised by tight apertures with an overall dynamic feeling. “It is our interpretation of the 21st-century Grotesk, exuberant, irruptive, and of course that winks at typefaces from the past such as Venus-Grotesk and Monotype Grotesque” state the duo behind the font’s design
