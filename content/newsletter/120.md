Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #120, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## News (from me)

I finally added syntax highlighting to my website. It should make some of those monster code blocks easier to digest. If you run a Hugo site and want to know how I did it, here’s my latest article on [Performant syntax highlighting in Hugo](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/performant-syntax-highlighting-in-hugo/).

Since [I simplified my build process](https://github.com/harrycresswell/harry) I’m really enjoying working with Hugo again, particularly for the build times – out of the box they’re unrivalled for speed.

It seems I’m not the only one enjoying the benefits of simplifying. Lots of people are writing about it. Clearly it’s what’s needed, particularly in the world of web development. There’s no denying, over the past few years things have become overly complicated and many of us have suffered as a consequence.

Let’s begin with more thoughts on complexity and the power of subtracting.

## Thought provoking

“The adding mindset is deeply ingrained. It’s easy to think I need something else. It’s hard to look instead at what to remove.” [Subtract](https://sivers.org/subtract) by Derek Sivers.

“When we declutter our designs to focus on the essentials, we create minimalist interfaces that are accessible for people with cognitive disabilities. And aesthetic.” Alex Chen in [Accessibility drives aesthetics](https://uxdesign.cc/accessibility-drives-aesthetics-5aef77b5d2aa).

## Design and Code

[Design more, resize less, with Auto Layout](https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/). Figma launches Auto layout – Buttons can resize with their text. Lists can rearrange themselves when items are moved around. And elements can be nested to create complex interfaces which respond to their content.
