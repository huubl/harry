Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Notes on Design Systems

I published a new article on [design system methodology](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/dsm/). If you’ve read my work on [design systems over on medium](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell) you might find this useful as it explores a few of the methods discussed in more detail.

“Design systems are thought to increase consistency and efficiency, and lead to gains in accessibility and team onboarding.”

[Sparkbox’s Design System Survey](https://designsystemssurvey.seesparkbox.com/) shares the results of 400 responses, including 86 from in-house organizations that use design systems. Worth noting, the site is an awesome usecase for [IBM Plex Serif](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).

## New in Typography

New font: [Roobert](http://displaay.net/typeface/roobert/) is a mono-linear geometrical sans-serif font family. Initially designed in collaboration with [Anymade Studio](http://anymadestudio.com/) as a bespoke typeface for Moogfest 2017. Read more about the typeface over on [It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/anymade-displaay-type-roobert-moogfest-graphic-design-020518).

[The Next Big Thing in Type?](http://thenextbigthingintype.umprum.cz/index.html) showcases the results of the semestral research of variable fonts, which took place in the 2017 Winter semester in the Type Design and Typography studio at the UMPRUM Academy in Prague.

[Obnoxiously Readable Responsive Text with Viewport Units](https://www.zachleat.com/web/obnoxiously-readable/) is a great read for developers on achieving beautifully large text.

## Productivity tools

I’m a huge fan of sites which aggregate helpful resources. This week I discovered [Shortcuts](http://shortcuts.design/); a compilation of all the different keyboard shortcuts for your favourite design tools.

For the illustrators amoung us, you may find [Illustration Tools](https://illustration.tools/) a useful addition to your arsenal.

## Interesting CSS reads

[Solved With CSS! Dropdown Menus](https://css-tricks.com/solved-with-css-dropdown-menus/) from Una Kravets and [Grid Level 2 and Subgrid](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2018/04/27/grid-level-2-and-subgrid/) by Rachel Andrew explore solving common problems with new CSS features. Well worth reading.

## For your ears

I watched [Eminem’s 8 Mile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylkOAtifuJ0) again, 16 years on it’s still as good as the first time I saw it. Here’s [the full soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA4tTqXOw4M2EfXETr0aeLwWw7Vt59EXQ).
