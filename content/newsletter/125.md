Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #125, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## News (from me)

[In Detail v.5](https://indtl.com/) is live. We’ve worked hard to re-aligning the website with the business direction. The new updates take us that bit closer to where we want to be.

I’ve been working through [Beginner JavaScript](https://beginnerjavascript.com/) by Wes Bos, which I highly recommend. I decided to publish some of my notes from the course. I’m sure Wes won’t mind.

First up, Understanding data types: [undefined vs null](https://harrycresswell.com/notes/js-data-types-null-undefined/#understanding-undefined) and [booleans and equality](https://harrycresswell.com/notes/js-data-types-boolean-equality/).

I also wrote something quick on [formatting dates in Gatsby](https://harrycresswell.com/notes/formatting-dates-gatsby/).

## Thought provoking

[I went to see a movie, and instead I saw the future](https://m.signalvnoise.com/i-went-to-see-a-movie-and-instead-i-saw-the-future/). Jason Fried pictures “a future that plans on everything going right so no one has to think about what happens when things go wrong. An automated future where no one actually knows how things work.”

[Write what you don't know](https://flaviocopes.com/write-what-you-dont-know/). Some thoughts from Flavio Copes on writing about things you don't know (yet).

## Design and Code

The typeface is [Labil Grotesk](https://www.kometa.xyz/typefaces/labil-grotesk), in case you’re wondering. Love those leaning alternate ligatures.

[Why You Should Choose HTML5 <article> Over <section>](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/html5-article-section/). Bruce Lawson explains why we should be using the <article> tag more than we think.

## Typography

“Make strong rules but don’t follow them blindly. We are designers and if we see something that looks weird, we have to react and find a solution.”

[Studio Feixen finally launches its very own “superfamily” of fonts](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/studio-feixen-fonts-graphic-design-140120).

[Should you self-host Google Fonts?](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/should-you-self-host-google-fonts/) Why it’s better for performance and privacy.
