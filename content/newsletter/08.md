Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. In case you missed it, [Winterhude](https://gumroad.com/l/winterhude) is my latest typeface release. A hand drawn san serif inspired by one of my all time favourites; [DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451), and named after [the best part of Hamburg](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=winterhude&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX5cnw0OXUAhWsD8AKHc11Aw8Q_AUIDCgD&biw=1200&bih=736#imgdii=LT5PSBjmPZFGAM:&imgrc=5lOyHzrlTewiRM:) (I may be biased, I live there). You can download it for free. I’m valuing [imperfection](https://thefunambulist.net/philosophy/philosophy-the-importance-of-imperfections-by-manuel-de-landa) right now, more than ever.

2. On the other hand, if perfecting web type is more your thing, this article [on responsive type](https://ia.net/topics/responsive-typography-the-basics/) is gold. For a tricky subject, this is a great place to start. I found it via [Zell](https://zellwk.com/about/), who’s also written some great articles on [typography for the web](https://zellwk.com/blog/responsive-typography/).

3. If you haven’t read it already; pick up a copy of [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens). But be prepared to [forget everything you thought you knew about humans](https://zenhabits.net/beginner/). Super interesting and full of mind-blowing stuff.

4. I saw [The Maccabees](http://www.themaccabees.co.uk/music/) last night, for perhaps [the last time ever](http://www.nme.com/news/music/maccabees-final-shows-emotional-felix-white-2096128). I can’t help but think they might just be pulling a [Coldplay](http://www.stereogum.com/1876669/chris-martin-sorry-coldplay-arent-breaking-up/news/) and they’ll be back in a few years. I hope they do. Either way, such a great show from a local band who’ve done so well over the years and bring back a lot of great memories.

5. For your ears: [Precious Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0629SPfofVI) by The Maccabees (of course). Here’s to the Maccabees and whatever they go on to next.

6. One to watch: [Under An Arctic Sky](http://www.underanarcticsky.com/) looks awesome. [Chris Burkard](https://www.instagram.com/chrisburkard/?hl=en) films 6 surfers as they take on the waves of a frozen Iceland. [The project was funded on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chrisburkard/under-an-arctic-sky-film) would you believe.
