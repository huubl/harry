Hey Folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. I launched [a new display font — Europa Brush](https://www.behance.net/gallery/54624013/Europa-Brush-FREE-Textured-Brush-Font). It’s already been downloaded over 60 times which I’m pretty surprised about. Turns out [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) is a great place to promote fonts, so far converting over 65% of views into customers. [Grab a free copy on Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/europa).

2. [I built and launched a website](https://typeservices.co/) (albeit a very basic one) as a home for my typefaces. It’s got a long way to go but I’m looking at it as an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) with plenty of room for improvement.

3. With all this launching stuff on my mind, I decided to write a quick article about it: [Launch now, perfect later](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/launch-now/). A few thoughts on the best way to launch for the greatest chance of success.

4. On another note, I watched [Mission Blue](https://www.mission-blue.org/) on Netflix. The documentary follows legendary marine biologist and ocean explorer [Dr. Sylvia Earle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Earle), on her life long mission to save our oceans. I feel embarrassed that I didn’t know about here before. [Her TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/sylvia_earle_s_ted_prize_wish_to_protect_our_oceans) delivers a poignant message about the current state of our oceans — another finite resource we're all responsible for but all too often take for granted.

5. Finally, I rediscovered [But Does It Float](http://butdoesitfloat.com/). Once upon a time one of my favourite go-to’s for visual inspiration. I must remember to visit it more often.
