Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #132, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people "learn in private", and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves. Again, that's fine, but we're here to talk about being in the top quintile. What you do here is to have **a habit of creating learning exhaust.”** [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public) from Shawn Wang.

”...writing can also be fun, matter-of-fact, rushed, bonkers, commercial, crass—and totally successful. Anything can work. Not everything does! But the gates of the city are wide open and there are a thousand ways in.” [Writing and lightness](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/writing-and-lightness/) from Robin Sloan and a response from Robin Rendle, also titled [Writing and lightness](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/writing-and-lightness.html).

## Design and Code

[Intercom on Product: Why making every day count is key to progress](https://www.intercom.com/blog/podcasts/intercom-on-product-ep09/). As Muhammad Ali once said "don't count the days; make the days count". A fantastic podcast from Des Traynor and Paul Adams on how to ensure you are doing just that.

## Typography

## New content (from me)

[The ‘show up every day’ conundrum](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/show-up-every-day-conundrum/). ‘Show up every day’ is generally very good advice, but often it leaves me feeling like I want more from it. In this short article I share what I mean by this.
