Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #162, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“Everything is a blank canvas where I can try out different aesthetics, interactions, copy, motion and more. I can break as many design rules as I want. There are no gatekeepers or stakeholders.” Paul Stamatiou in [Side projects](https://paulstamatiou.com/side-projects/).

“...specializing is a pretty good idea, and I think you will end up specializing to some degree whether you plan to or not. If you have the good fortune to plan, pick things that you like. You’ll do just fine.” Chris Coyier in [The Widening Responsibility for Front-End Developers](https://css-tricks.com/the-widening-responsibility-for-front-end-developers/).

## Design and Code

[CSS Variables 101](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-vars-101/). Ahmad Shadeed shares pretty much everything you need to know about CSS variables with lots of examples and use-cases.

## Typography

[Munken Sans](https://colab.munken.com/munken-sans) was inspired by the Swedish typeface Tratex, designed by Kåge Gustafson for national road signs in the 1960s. It’s available in three weights: regular, medium and bold and free to download.

Geoff Graham explains how to use the CSS [font-optical-sizing](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-optical-sizing/) property to adjust the outline of font glyphs to make them more legible at different sizes.
