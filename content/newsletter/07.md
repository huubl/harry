Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/) are bringing back [the classic travel poster](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=classic+travel+posters&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjd3NbgztPUAhXRI1AKHaGUAgEQ_AUICigB&biw=1401&bih=776) as part of their [Experiences feature](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/experiences?allow_override%5B%5D=&s_tag=HMp9NX6i). [Working with local artists and designers](https://airbnb.design/the-return-of-the-travel-poster/) to capture the vibe of 12 different cities. Some great illustration.

2. Humour me whilst I go all design geek, here are [10 Principles for Good Design](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design) as proposed by design veteran [Dieter Rams](https://dieterrams.tumblr.com/). For those who don’t know, Rams was head of design at German brand Braun from 1961 - 1995, he is responsible for some [the companies most iconic design](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dieter+rams+braun&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidqu6a0dPUAhVFmbQKHcq-CJ4Q_AUICigB&biw=1401&bih=776). Always worth looking back over his words from time to time.

3. After watching this video of author [Danny Gregory](http://www.dannygregory.com/) going through [his collection of old diaries](https://dannygregorysblog.com/2017/05/24/dear-diary/), I decided to pick up [a 5 year diary](https://www.amazon.co.uk/5-Year-Diary-Tamara-Shopsin/dp/0977648192/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1498210511&sr=8-6&keywords=5+year+diary). I’m sick of forgetting what I’ve been up to. I’ve also been trying (..and failing) to write more, but sitting down in front of a blank page and then trying to fill it is daunting. 6 lines a day on the other hand seems doable.

4. For your ears: [Nils Frahm](http://www.nilsfrahm.com/) is my go-to when I need to listen to something different. In particular, [this performance at Montreux Jaxx festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izhGLGPmvIU&t=1924s) back in 2015 is a favourite. Frahm has just announced [a worldwide tour](http://www.nilsfrahm.com/concerts/) kicking off in Berlin early next year.

5. [Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/) has started [a podcast](https://www.nateliason.com/podcast/). Although it’s aimed at college students and recent grads I’ve been enjoying it none the less.
