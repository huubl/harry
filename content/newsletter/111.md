Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #111, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

Here’s your weekly roundup of interesting links on design, code and typography.

This week I’ve included two quotes from [Design as Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6095883-design-as-art), the Penguin Classic by Bruno Munari. I picked up a copy whilst at Tate Modern for the [Dóra Maurer](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/dora-maurer) exhibition. Both book and exhibition challenge the way we view the world.

## Thought provoking

“Subtract rather than add: this rule must be understood in the sense of reaching simplicity, getting at the essence of the object by eliminating anything superfluous until no further simplification is possible.”

”By designing without any stylistic or formal preconceived notions, and tending towards the natural formation of things, one gets the essence of a product.”

Bruno Munari in [Design as Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6095883-design-as-art).
