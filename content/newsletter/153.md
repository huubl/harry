Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #153, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

## Design and Code

[Getting the horizontal and vertical centers of an element](https://zellwk.com/blog/horizontal-and-vertical-centers-of-an-element/). Zell Liew show how to use JavaScript’s `getBoundingClientRect` to get information about the bounding box, then build a function to make things simple and reusable.

## Typography

Grilli Type release [GT Flexa](https://www.gt-flexa.com/) which embraces the idea of a fluid design space. Its creators, Dominik & Marc, spent six years fine-tuning GT Flexa’s concept and character. The result is an impressively extensive typographic system with a unique personality.

Thanks to Google Fonts, [all fonts by Etcetera Type Company are now open-source](https://www.etceteratype.co/blog/state-of-etc) and free for all, forever.
