Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #116, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

I’ve always been fascinated by mindset. And what we can achieve by having a good one. This week I came across a wonderful old piece called [Believe you can change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck) by the late Aaron Swartz, so following a few updates from me, we’ll begin this issue with a quote from that.

## News (from me)

I finally added a section to my website to showcase some of my favourite projects. First up is [Albion Cycling](https://harrycresswell.com/projects/albion/), a project I worked on a while back with my good friend Luke Harvey.

I’ve been working on improving the desktop experience on the [AIN Jobs board](https://www.jobs.angelinvestmentnetwork.co.uk/jobs/humanising-autonomy-sales-development-representative) and also redesigned the cards on [SeedTribe Hub](https://hub.seedtribe.com/webinars). I’m sure I’ve done a bunch of other things too, but it’s been a busy one and I’m struggling to remember exactly what?!

## Thought provoking

“Fixed-mindset people feel smart when they don’t make mistakes, growth-mindset people feel smart when they struggle with something for a long time and then finally figure it out. Fixies try to blame the world when things go bad, growthers look to see what they can change about themselves. Fixies are afraid to try hard — because if they fail, it means they’re a failure. Growthers are afraid of not trying.” [Believe you can change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck) by Aaron Swartz.
