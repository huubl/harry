Hey folks,

I’m back to it after a week skiing in the French Alps, so here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Aggregating data using Airtable

I often find myself opening old issues of these emails trying to hunt down the tools and articles I’ve mentioned. After reading that [Airtable just raised $52M](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/airtable-raises-52m-to-give-non-coders-tools-to-build-complex-software/) in funding, I had an idea.

Maybe I could aggregate all the content from these emails into an Airtable (effectively is a customisable spreadsheet), making a searchable tool to accompany the email.

[Brain—tactics: The Table](https://airtable.com/shr4aEdLsGfUXTj6p) is the results of my very early efforts to catalog the various articles, tools, books, videos, songs, people etc mentioned in these emails. I hope you find it useful.

If you have any feedback or ideas of how I can make it better hit reply on this email! I plan on doing a few tutorials on using Airtable to do all sorts of stuff to help your business. There’s tons of cool templates to get you started in the meantime.

Also worth a read is [How to build a content marketing pipeline](https://blog.airtable.com/how-to-build-a-content-marketing-pipeline/) and [How to build a UX research system that runs on autopilot](https://airtable.news/how-to-build-a-ux-research-system-that-runs-on-autopilot-1a9ff3f4c244).

## Netflix Sans a custom typeface by Dalton Maag

Following their success with [BBC Keith](https://www.daltonmaag.com/work/bbc-reith), South London type design studio [Dalton Maag team up with Netflix to develop Netflix Sans](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/netflix-sans-typeface-dalton-maag-graphic-design-210318). It seems like theres a growing trend for big brands and custom typefaces.

[A Typeface is not a tool](https://klim.co.nz/blog/a-typeface-is-not-a-tool/) is something else I read recently on type which I enjoyed.

## The first visual identity for UK parliment

[SomeOne designs a simpler, more coherent visual identity for UK Parliament](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/someone-design-agency-uk-parliament-visual-identity-graphic-design-200318). You can [see the full case study](https://someoneinlondon.com/projects/the-first-visual-identity-for-uk-parliament) on the SomeOne website.

## A 101 on icon design

A good read on [getting icon design right](https://medium.muz.li/icon-set-3b4fc87dc6b5) by [Slava Shestopalov](https://medium.muz.li/@shestopalov.v).

## For your ears

I’ve been enjoying [the sound of Rival Consoles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4gSk5GibB8) this week. Particularly [Ghosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBpNfFKHtMg&list=RDEMfRfuk_FdNkfls3_ZmYZb4Q&index=8). If you like [Jon Hopkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q04ILDXe3QE), or anything which sounds big, is electronic and full of texture you’re bound to like his music.

Talking of Jon Hopkins, his new Album [Singularity](https://jonhopkins.dominomart.com/singularity-signed-deluxe-lp) is released on 4th May, here’s [Emerald Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sk0uDbM5lc&list=RDEMfRfuk_FdNkfls3_ZmYZb4Q&index=7) taken from the album. Love this new animation vibe.
