Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Block Element Modifier, then what?

[Grandchild elements in BEM](https://assortment.io/posts/grandchild-elements-bem-css) takes a look at some best practices for dealing with the complexities of markup which can’t be solved with vanilla BEM.

## Subatomic Design Systems

“These systems are designed to change over time and as an organisation or product grows—to be restrictive enough to represent a whole, but flexible enough to easily evolve and meet divergent needs.”

Dan Eden sharing his theory of [Subatomic Design Systems](https://daneden.me/2018/01/05/subatomic-design-systems/#fn1).

## Better Typography with Font Variants

[Jonathan Harrell on using font variants](https://jonathan-harrell.com/better-typography-font-variants/) (not to be confused with variable fonts) to create ligatures, caps, numerals and alternate glyphs and improve your web typography.

## Sketch Library vs. Design System

“...at the heart of any great design system is a reusable set of UI components that product teams can reach for to build actual software.”

[Your Sketch Library is Not a Design System](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/your-sketch-library-is-not-a-design-system/) is another important read from Atomic Design Methodlogy’s Brad Frost.

I’ve written a fair amount on [using Sketch Libraries to build better design systems](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell) but having read Brad’s article I realise how easily this can be misconstrued. Building component libraries in Sketch is essentially just another piece in the puzzle of design systems. The end goal is always a ‘living component Library’ which you can use in production. At AIN we use [Fabricator](https://fbrctr.github.io/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to handle regular deployments to [AIN Labs](https://www.ainlabs.com/), which then updates our live codebases. It’s nothing fancy but it gets the job done and it’s easy to manage as a small team.

Perhaps my next series of articles should be From Sketch to Living Component Library?.

## Medium partner with Unsplash

[Every photo on Unsplash now available in Medium](https://medium.com/unsplash/medium-unsplash-2fee8d662dd1?vero_id=56453&vero_conv=PmNPLiUVlfrNjJJhv63oChkpIeAhR2G8XzCeThlHmBLT_KQeo5BZ7fckVqIKWkSSWFXV9kWExzfkZjsUto0WCUGqPuI0zY32). This is big news for writers and photographers looking for exposure. Medium and Unsplash are giants, their reach is huge. Write more, take more pictures.

## For your ears

[Night Sky](https://open.spotify.com/album/2kjf9kwmRjzJbe7OxbuQLP) by Australia Pianist [Sophie Hutchings](https://www.sophiehutchings.com/) is a phenomenal album. If you like [Nils Frahm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izhGLGPmvIU&t=1924s) or [Max Richter](http://www.maxrichtermusic.com/) then you will enjoy this.
