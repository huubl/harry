Hi Folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [Creative Review talks to Lukas Paltram](https://www.creativereview.co.uk/dalton-maag-custom-font-bbc-reith/), creative director of Brixon based type foundry [Dalton Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/) about the process behind creating a custom typeface for the BBC. [BBC Reith](https://www.daltonmaag.com/work/bbc-reith) is slowly being rolled out across all BBC platforms. Right now you can see it in use on [the BBC website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport) and updated logo.

2. Remember [that time Elon Musk said he's almost certain reality is a simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KK_kzrJPS8). The latest video from [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt): [Is Reality Real? The Simulation Argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlTKTTt47WE) does a good job of explaining what the hell he was talking about when he said that.

3. If this sort of thing doesn't hurt your head, then I highly recommend reading [Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus). Home Deus is the follow up to [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens) by [Yuval Noah Harari](http://www.ynharari.com/), which I shared a while back. The book explores how the pursuit for god-like power though technology and 'intellegent design' will impact the future of humanity. The subjects of human consciousness and reality are integral parts of Harari's argument.

4. UI designers: here's a great article by the [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/) team on [The Psychology Principles Every UI/UX Designer Needs to Know](https://blog.marvelapp.com/psychology-principles-every-uiux-designer-needs-know/?utm_source=weekly-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=marvel-newsletter-2017-09-15&utm_term=). Sketch users: here's the very entertaining [Pablo Stanley demonstrating Libraries,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suP1sOU4J3E) the insanely powerful new feature coming up in [Sketch 47](https://www.sketchapp.com/beta/).

5. Music listeners: [Goldie – Timeless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv64JhpGWAs). Probably the most important Drum and Bass album ever made.
