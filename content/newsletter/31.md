Hi folks,

A very happy new year to you all. I hope you enjoyed the holidays. Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Systems vs goals

“...goals are good for _planning_ your progress and systems are good for actually _making_ progress.”

I'm sure we all have goals we’d like to accomplish in 2018. In [this short article](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems) James Clear explains why focusing on systems is a far more effective way to making things happen.

## Typeface vs Font

[Should the terms font and typeface be used interchangeably?](https://typography.guru/journal/should-the-terms-font-and-typeface-be-used-interchangeably-r58/) Ralf Herrmann does an excellent job at answers what may be the most widely argued topic in design, using some clever music related analogies and a few venn diagrams for good measure.

## Typography Reviews

[Typographica](http://typographica.org/) is an extensive resource of typeface reviews, book reviews and type commentary. I’m a sucker for type reviews, I'm not sure why it's taken so long to share this one.

## CSS Grid Course

Over the holidays [Per Harald Borgen](https://medium.com/@perborgen) released his [free 13 part CSS Grid course](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/heres-my-free-css-grid-course-merry-christmas-3826dd24f098) which I mentioned a while back. If you work with CSS I highly recommend taking the course. 2018 is the year for Grid. The videos are nice and short and well explained.

## Deutschland 83

I’ve been watching [Deutschland 83](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/deutschland-83) (in order to practice my German), which I highly recommend—even if you have zero interest in the language. It follows a 24-year-old native of East Germany who is sent to the West as an undercover spy for the HVA. Here's [the full soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Hs2AQwDgA&list=PLQw_lbCD4XSZgnzhMOQ_cRrwbp6FV31oQ) for your ears. Expect viele 80’s hits.
