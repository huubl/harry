Hi Folks,

Here’s this weeks hoard of noteworthy links from around the internet...

## Thought provoking

_“Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance.”_

– Confucius

Freedom of Thought on [how to master your emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGQQ7pJQqHk).

## Design and Code

[Slack rebrand](https://slack.com/) with a new identity and logo by Pentagram partner Michael Bierut. CSS Grid friends will enjoy the new homepage layout. \*\*\*\*

In [Designing Your Site Like It’s 1998](https://24ways.org/2018/designing-your-site-like-its-1998/), Andy Clarke reflects on the techniques he would have used to develop a website 20 years ago.

[My Grid Layout](https://www.kizu.ru/my-grid-layout/). Roman Komarov shares his approach of combining CSS Variables with CSS Grid to achieve his blog layout.

Ire Aderinokun talks through her [CSS Reset](https://bitsofco.de/my-css-reset-base/).

## Typography

Wahaca rebrand with [a custom typeface by Without Studio](https://without.studio/projects/wahaca-rebrand/%0A).

A rather more quirky custom font I’m enjoying is [IFM Paris](https://www.ifmparis.fr/en/%0A), designed for the Institut Français de la Mode. If anyone knows who designed let me know!

[Swiss type design studio Dinamo creates two new type tools](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/dinamo-dark-dark-room-and-pipeline-graphic-design-240119), which the designers explain act as a way “to test drive the truth of variable fonts.”

## Something to watch
