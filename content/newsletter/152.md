Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #152, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“When you don’t lower the barrier to entering the design industry, only a really specific type of designer with a really specific type of background is able to get in.” Fabricio Teixeira in [Our industry needs more designers. Most importantly: a different type of designer.](https://uxdesign.cc/our-industry-needs-more-designers-most-importantly-a-different-type-of-designer-dc98cfae4411)

[Covid-19 is changing how designers think](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/perspectives/wireframe-podcast/covid19-changing-how-designers-think-episode-14/).

## Design and Code

[Button state and accessibility](https://gomakethings.com/button-state-and-accessibility/). Chris Ferdinandi explains the problem with “active state” classes, like `.is-active`, added to elements to modify their appearance and how you can solve the problem with the `[aria-pressed]` attribute.

## Typography

[The designers guide to letter-spacing](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2020/07/the-designers-guide-to-letter-spacing/) from Denis Valetin. Most of the information we consume happens through reading, so it makes a lot of sense to pay attention to the words when designing.

## Something to watch

Tatiana Mac on [Hacking Digital Style Guides for Accessibility: Type, Colour, Imagery](https://youtu.be/tvpstrkDgeM). “Accessible design is more important than ever, with over 15% of people affected by a disability that changes how they interact with the web. As designers, it is our responsibility to ensure our designs are inclusive and reflect all of our users' needs.”
