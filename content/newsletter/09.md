Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. What I’m reading right now: [Failed It](http://de.phaidon.com/store/general-non-fiction/failed-it-9780714871196/) by Erik Kessels. A short but insightful read on making a success out of screwing up. [Kessels](http://www.kessels.de/) celebrates failure and imperfection, suggesting that original ideas are often found in accidents and moments of serendipity. [Perfect is boring](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/542754192562885062/) after all.

2. I’ve found the articles written by the [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/) team invaluable throughout the time I’ve spent building front end UI kits and Sketch component libraries. In particular, this article on [designing a maintainable style guide in Sketch](https://blog.marvelapp.com/creating-maintaining-marvel-style-guide-sketch/) and this one on [building front end components](https://blog.marvelapp.com/the-marvel-styleguide/). Building design systems is by no means easy, but taking the time to make one makes building scalable digital products infinitely easier! I plan to share my entire process soon as there are so many ways it can be done.

3. If you’re sick of [staring at your to do list](http://www.ja-pics.net/images/full/3/926eeb0d4.gif), here’s a refreshing, anxiety-inducing product from GFDA: [the Fuck It list](https://goodfuckingdesignadvice.com/products/fuck-it-list). Sometimes it’s got to be said.

4. A few nights ago, I was paging through the works of [Max Huber](http://de.phaidon.com/store/design/max-huber-9780714861104/). It set me off on a [Swiss Style](http://www.designishistory.com/home/swiss/) binge, looking back over the works of a few more graphic design pioneers: [Joseph Müller-Brockmann](https://www.google.de/search?q=paul+rand&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT3r2I5PbUAhWQYVAKHRwQCjoQ_AUIBigB&biw=1438&bih=776#tbm=isch&q=Joseph+M%C3%BCller-Brockmann), famed for his work on the grid system and [Paul Rand](http://www.paul-rand.com/), the undisputed king of [corporate identity design](https://www.google.de/search?q=paul+rand&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjT3r2I5PbUAhWQYVAKHRwQCjoQ_AUIBigB&biw=1438&bih=776#tbm=isch&q=paul+rand+logos).

5. For your ears: You’ve been there before, when Youtube starts doing it’s own thing and you stumble upon a bit of a gem. Thanks to a clever Google algorythm I now know [Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works 85-92](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw5AiRVqfqk).
