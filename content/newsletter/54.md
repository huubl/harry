Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week

## Design techniques

[Once through cleanly](https://austinkleon.com/2018/06/07/once-through-cleanly/) is a response from Austin Kleon to Frank Chimero’s design method where “...you think about your idea, sketch, then put some glue in your chair and bang it out in one sitting.”

[How to ask questions](https://uxrfieldguide.com/how-to-ask-questions/): the difference between building the right product and building something we think is right.

## Typography and tools

[Evolving the 100% Pure New Zealand identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvZ9x6lOPCQ) is a short documentary from 2015 on the development of [Pure Pākati](https://klim.co.nz/custom-fonts/pure-pakati/) a typeface based on wood block printing by Klim Type Foundry. [Read the design information](https://klim.co.nz/blog/pure-pakati-design-information/) for more on it’s creation.

Fans of the popular [Circular](https://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular/) typeface will enjoy the more affordable [Cerebri Sans](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hanken-designco/cerebri-sans/), see it in the wild on the [Template Studio](https://template-studio.nl/) website.

You can now [identify fonts in images using Font face ninja](https://twitter.com/FontFaceNinja/status/1014080229034389504). I’ve been using this tool for a while now to find and bookmark typefaces from various sources online.

## Something to watch

[Plastic Pollution: How Humans are Turning the World into Plastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7IzU2VJIQ&feature=youtu.be) The new video from Kurzgesagt which answers the question: Why has plastic turned into a problem and what do we know about its dangers?

## For your ears

Music by [Voyeur](https://twitter.com/Voyeur__Music) often gets me through the day. Notable tracks include [Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngG7tSgR6XA) and [Nina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d92V7U5aEpc&index=3&list=PLYLP4NcX6ZC9MuhKr2VJJrvkMi0jflWYO). Word of warning, for no explicit search results use “Voyeur music”.
