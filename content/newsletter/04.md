Hey folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. [Learn to love less](http://mnmlist.com/learn-to-love-less/). Something I’ve been working on for a while now. The idea in a nutshell: The less you have the more you appreciate things and so the happier you are.

2. Approaching life with [beginners mind](https://zenhabits.net/beginner/). I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. It’s so easy to get stuck in our ways the more experienced we get. We start churning out stale ideas and eventually fall behind. This concept is taken from Zen Buddhism. It helps to forget what you know and approach problems from a fresh perspective.

3. On that note here’s a crash course on [how not to suck at design](https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-not-suck-at-design-a-5-minute-guide-for-the-non-designer-291efac43037).

4. I started using [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) years ago, when [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) was a big thing. It was one of the only way follow websites and blogs before the likes of Instagram and Twitter. I’d almost forgotten about it but recently re-discovered how useful it is. Especially now there’s so much noise out there competing for your attention.

5. For your ears: [Louie Austen - Hoping (Herbert’s High Dub)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA4Z5QulE5U). One for the summer, when it finally arrives. Stolen from one of my favourite boiler room sets by [Solomun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk6Xst6euQk).
