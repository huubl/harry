Hi Folks,

Here’s this weeks hoard of interesting links from around the internet...

## Thought provoking

[The Downside of Work-Life Balance](https://jamesclear.com/four-burners-theory) by James Clear.

[What is a UX Strategy](https://www.antonsten.com/uxstrategy/) from Auton Sten.

## Design and Code

Thomas Lowry on [Everything you need to know about layout grids in Figma](https://www.figma.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-layout-grids-in-figma/).

[Preload, prefetch and other <link> tags](https://3perf.com/blog/link-rels/) from Ivan Akulov.

[Inclusively Hidden](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html). Scott Hara on the various ways to hide content and the different effects they have on the accessibility.

[Creating an aspect ratio CSS utility](https://andy-bell.design/wrote/creating-an-aspect-ratio-css-utility/) by Andy Bell.

## Typography

[ETC Trispace](https://www.etc.supply/trispace/). A wacky almost monospaced variable font from Etcetera Type Company.

[12 things I learned in type school](https://medium.com/@pcho/12-things-i-learned-in-type-school-a672fd35825f). Peter Cho summarises his year as a student in the Type@CooperWest Extended program.

Nodding to its historical roots in the 1920s, [Gangster Grotesk by Pizza Typefaces](https://www.freshfonts.io/) is a contemporary typeface that combines a sharp contrast with angled terminal strokes that curve inward ever so slightly.

## Something to watch

[How sampling transformed music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3TF-hI7zKc). Sampling isn't about "hijacking nostalgia wholesale," says Mark Ronson. It's about inserting yourself into the narrative of a song while also pushing that story forward.
