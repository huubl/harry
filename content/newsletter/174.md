Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #174.

This month we go deeper into working with Eleventy and Sanity. You’ll also find a great read on information overload, which I think we all struggle with from time to time.

There’s a piece on creating privacy-friendly video embeds – yes it’s a thing! And we have a new platform for really good free fonts. Let’s face it... who doesn’t like free fonts? As usual there’s plenty of other interesting bits and pieces from in and around the world of web development.

## Thought provoking

“Thoroughly processing what you read increases the quality of your learning; inevitably, you generate questions that lead to better mastery.” [The One Thing You Need To Learn To Fight Information Overload](https://leananki.com/fight-information-overload/) from Al Khan.

“It’s in this in-between state that we get to reinvent ourselves. Reinvent who we want to be, what kind of impact we’d like to create. We get to reinvent the new world, as it emerges!”

Leo Babauta in [Meaningful Impact When the New World Has Not Emerged Yet](https://zenhabits.net/new-world/)

“Watching, observing, questioning, and exploring” Regine Gilbert in [Keeping Your Design Mind New and Fresh](https://alistapart.com/article/keeping-a-fresh-design-mind/).

I just launched [a new website for BuxtonThreeTwo](https://buxtonthreetwo.com/), designed in Figma and built using Sanity and Eleventy.

## Design and Code

## Typography

[Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/) is a free fonts service launched by the Indian Type Foundry (ITF). It’s a growing collection of professional grade fonts that are 100% free for personal and commercial use.

## Something to watch

[This series on Page transitions with Barba.js and GSAP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkEZWD8wbltmopvSzUvXw9itOosGXPEJ6) from Petr Tichy is excellent. Admittedly, I’ve not done much with animation before, but I’ve been learning lots for a current project. It’s a lot of fun and I highly recommend Petr’s tutorials as a starting point.
