Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #130, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“The combination of design constraints, styles, and variants of a visual design system tends to result in something larger than the sum of its parts. This more holistic view is something I've started to call the Design Graph.”

Brent Jackson on [The Design Graph](https://jxnblk.com/blog/design-graph/), a constraint-based system for organising styles in UI design.

[The cannabis conundrum: How should designers navigate the marijuana business?](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/the-cannabis-conundrum-gossamer-eddie-opara-blok-daye-graphic-design-180220) It’s a visually rich playground for designers, but – since its recent partial legalisation and de-stigmatisation – the cannabis space appears to be having an identity crisis.

## Design and Code

[A Complete Guide to Data Attributes](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-data-attributes/). Did you know you can make up your own HTML attributes and put your own information inside them? Chris Coyier shows what’s possible.

[Let’s Define CSS 4](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4770). It’s come up quite a few times recently that the world of people who make websites would greatly benefit from the CSS Working Group officially defining ”CSS 4”, and later “CSS 5“, etc.

[Styling The Good Ol' Button Element](https://ishadeed.com/article/styling-the-good-old-button/). The definitive article on links vs buttons, and how to style them in a variety of different situations. From Ahmad Shadeed.

[Making a Gigposter](https://mxb.dev/blog/making-a-gigposter/). Something a bit different from Max Böck.

## Typography

[Durex’s “sex positive” rebrand introduces One Night Sans typeface](https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/10-16-february-2020/durex-rebrand-one-night-sans/).The font was designed by London-based typographers Colophon Foundry and intends to be “characterful”, while also being flexible enough to work across a range of “verbal and visual tones”, according to Fruzza.

[Font pairing: A guide to combining multiple typefaces and fonts](https://deesignre.com/a-guide-to-font-pairing/). Simple straight-forward advice from Mark Vogelaar.

[Le Murmure](https://murmure.me/en/project/le-murmure/) is an open-source typeface designed for editorial use. Its highly condensed proportions draw their inspiration from magazine titling fonts. You can [download it for free](http://velvetyne.fr/fonts/le-murmure/).

UK-born type designer Rutherford Craze has launched a new type foundry [Mass-Driver™](https://mass-driver.com/), with two new fonts; a general practice system serif and an unconventional family centred around an 8×8 pixel font.

## Something to watch

[Ecommerce with JAMstack CMS and Netlify](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/555042234). Shipping ecommerce sites on the JAMstack is more approachable than you might think.
