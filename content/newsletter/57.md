Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week

## Design, prototyping and React

[Awesome Design Systems](https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems), a curated list of design systems, pattern libraries and everything in between.

[How to quickly prototype apps with CSS Grid and CSS Variables](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-quickly-prototype-apps-with-css-grid-and-css-variables-8d3d96d68eaa) from Per Harald Borgen

Friends working with React; Meng To just released [React for Designers](https://designcode.io/react), a 6-hour course which aims to make React more approachable for designers.

## Typefaces and tools

“Each character is full of intricacies and begs to be used at monolithic sizes so the contrast can be properly appreciated.”

Font review Journal’s Bethany Heck talks massive slab strokes and delicate hairlines in [her write up of Maelstrom](http://fontreviewjournal.com/maelstrom/), the reverse-stress typeface from [Klim Type Foundry](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/maelstrom/).

Font in the wild: [Archivo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo), a grotesque sans serif typeface family from Omnibus-Type seen here on the [Relay for Figma](https://relayforfigma.com/) website.

Matej Latin author of [Better Web Type](https://betterwebtype.com/) just launched [Web Typography Resources](https://betterwebtype.com/web-typography-resources), a growing list of web typography related apps, tools, plugins and other resources for web designers and web developers.

## Reading techniques

Do you know about fractal reading? I found [this part](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-way-you-read-books-says-a-lot-about-your-intelligence-find-out-why-c2127b00eb03?inf_contact_key=8fd133a3034222e8841accdf2c45fa16f4272181965875b2beda821f6de7e031#59fb) of Michael Simmons’ article [The Way You Read Books Says A Lot About Your Intelligence, Here’s Why](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-way-you-read-books-says-a-lot-about-your-intelligence-find-out-why-c2127b00eb03?inf_contact_key=8fd133a3034222e8841accdf2c45fa16f4272181965875b2beda821f6de7e031#59fb) very interesting.

## Remote working

[Reflections on being a remote developer](https://blog.cronhub.io/reflections-on-being-a-remote-developer/), an enjoyable read from Tigran Hakobyan, software engineer at Buffer.

P.S – I just published the [Static search with Algolia and Hugo 2](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/hugo-algolia-2/), the second part in a short series on Algolia Instant Search and the static site generator Hugo.
