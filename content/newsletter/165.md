Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #165, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“We believe that the internet must serve our collective liberation and ecological sustainability. We want the internet to dismantle the power structures that delay climate action and for the internet itself to become a sustainable and positive force for climate justice.”

## Typography

”[Clamp](https://utopia.fyi/blog/clamp/) seems to be most useful when you want broadly fluid typography, without being 100% specific about the relationship between the varying sizes.” Trys Mudford on adding clamp() support to the Utopia fluid responsive type project.

[Humans are Bad at URLs and Fonts Don’t Matter](https://www.troyhunt.com/humans-are-bad-at-urls-and-fonts-dont-matter/).

New from Monkrom, [Fabric Serif](https://monokrom.no/fonts/fabricserif) is a stringent Roman with a sharp finish, complete with all the features you’ve come to expect from a reliable text typeface. [Fabric Sans](https://monokrom.no/fonts/fabricsans) is an unassuming straight-sided grotesque. The design is guided by the interplay of apertures and letterspacing – a low-contrast typeface with high-contrast whitespace, hiding a radiant texture in plain sight.
