Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #160, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“Through integrating the full cycle into policy, improving designs and repairability, informing consumers about their decisions and incentivising green buying, Europe and its partners could lead the world in the development and promotion of sustainable internet technologies.“ Louis Stupple-Harris in [Internet of Waste: How Europe can make the internet green](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/internet-waste-how-europe-can-make-internet-green/).

“Things that lead to poor performance are things that take energy.” Chris Coyier in [Thinking About Power Usage and Websites](https://css-tricks.com/thinking-about-power-usage-and-websites/).

## Design and Code

## Typography

Dinamo Type launch their new website and release two new typefaces alongside: [ABC Maxi](https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/maxi) and [ABC Diatype](https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/diatype). The former is bold and exuberantly expressive, the other is a subtle, screen-reading-friendly grotesque.

[Orna](https://www.emilyjschan.com/orna) by Emily Jing Sum Chan falls in the realm of display typefaces influenced by Art Nouveau and Blackletter Calligraphy, all while emphasized under a contemporary light.

[Talona](http://www.ethannakache.com/talona/) is the latest release from graphic designer Ethan Nakache. Talona combines traditional and modern inspirations to produce a display typeface. “The main idea of the design was to take a classic drawing from the Didot and apply an oblique contrast axis and long serifs.“
