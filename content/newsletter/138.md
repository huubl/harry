Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #138, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“This storm will pass. But the choices we make now could change our lives for years to come.” [The world after coronavirus](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=7fddea606e&e=6105dcf671) by Yuval Noah Harari.

“Let’s face it: Things are far from ‘business as usual.’” [Call Paul](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=20af2f74fd&e=6105dcf671) is a new podcast from Paul Jarvis who has thoughtful conversations with small business owners and entrepreneurs negotiating new economic realities from the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Design and Code

[A Static Future](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=4071d81e99&e=6105dcf671). Fantastic read from Josh Comeau on the misconceptions around exactly what tools like Gatsby are capable of.

[What is a Static Site Generator? And 3 ways to find the best one](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=491e49725d&e=6105dcf671). Anything Phil Hawksworth writes is well worth reading. This one is no different.

[< css-doodle />](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=2600253d1b&e=6105dcf671). An awesome web component for drawing patterns with CSS. Have a play around with it to see all the cool patterns you can make.

[The Shape of Design](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=6d7dc47d3c&e=6105dcf671) by Frank Chimero has just been reprinted. Instead of talking about typography, grids, or logos, it focuses on storytelling, co-dependency, and craft.

Michael Scharnagl tweeted about [100 CSS properties over 100 days](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=7c48cedf69&e=6105dcf671) and shared the entire list in a post. Great idea.

## Typography

Jeremiah Shoaf has started a new series where he identifies the fonts used in popular non-web things like movie posters, TV shows and book covers. The first instalment is [The Fonts in Popular Things Identified Vol. 1](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/fonts-in-popular-things-identified-vol-1).

[1403 Vintage Mono Pro](https://1403.slantedhall.com/). A practical monospaced typeface, inspired by the IBM 1403 mainframe line printer from the 1960s. Designed by Jeff Kellem.

[Open Sauce](https://www.behance.net/gallery/94876543/Open-Sauce-Sans-Typeface). A sans-serif superfamily which includes no less than 14 styles (7 weights plus matching italics), designed by Alfredo Marco Pradil for Creative Sauce. It’s optimised for body/smaller size text on screen and print.

[Asymmetric Typography Book Notes](https://typestudies.com/posts/asymmetric-typography-book-notes/) by John D. Jameson.

## Something to watch

[An Event Apart have published the 12 remaining sessions from AEA DC 2019](https://aneventapart.com/news/post/the-complete-aea-dc-2019-now-online) in one fell swoop. Each session offers a unique, expert perspective on aspects of the web, interaction design, and user experience, from our industry’s best speakers and greatest visionaries.

## Content (from me)

[Local London](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=b3f098e87e&e=6105dcf671) is a project I’ve been working on with my friends Rozzy and Beanie to help London folk support independent London based food & drink suppliers, who sell online and deliver to your door. The website lists over 180 suppliers and we’ll be adding new ones each day.

[Listing page content in Hugo](https://harrycresswell.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4e8fba8d0ab4a857159c0104e&id=b41e68a32a&e=6105dcf671). A quick technical post on the variables, functions and templates you need to know about when listing page content on Hugo static sites.
