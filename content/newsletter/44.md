Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Resources for a serverless future

[The Power of Serverless](https://thepowerofserverless.info/) aggregates all the services, ideas and resources needed for serverless web development in one place. Made by Chris Coyier and the Codepen team, no doubt this will become a very helpful tool.

## Become a better writer

[21 Tactics to Help You Become a Better Writer](https://www.nateliason.com/better-writer/) by Nat Eliason, who’s a fantastic writer! And [The 10 Most Common Writing Mistakes You Should Avoid Making](https://zapier.com/blog/writing-mistakes/) from [Melanie Pinola](https://twitter.com/melaniepinola), Managing Editor at Zapier.

## Building Buttons

[Designing Button States](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/designing-button-states/) is a great place to start for theory behind designing buttons.

Following that [Buttons in Design Systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/buttons-in-design-systems-eac3acf7e23) by [Nathan Curtis](https://medium.com/@nathanacurtis) and my own article [Using Sketch Libraries and primitives to build an even better system of buttons](https://medium.com/@harrycresswell/using-sketch-libraries-and-primitives-to-build-an-even-better-system-of-buttons-ecc8f25486ac) for a rock solid Sketch workflow.

## A type family with a twist

Zurich-based type design studio [Nouvelle Noire](https://www.nouvellenoire.ch/) – in collaboration with [Rudolf Barmettler](http://vvk.zhdk.ch/personen/team/rudolf-barmettler/) – has released [Rektorat](https://www.nouvellenoire.ch/product/rektorat/), a type family adapted from original hand painted letterings from 1933, which were [discovered beneath some wallpaper](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/nouvelle-noir-rudolf-barmettler-rektorat-graphic-design-120418) during a renovation.

## Tim Ferris talks to Karlie Kloss

I really enjoyed the [Karlie Kloss interview on the Tim Ferris Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ3hrVhYfew). Karlie Kloss is an impressive human being — entrepreneur and supermodel... who can write a Ruby on Rails app. Enough said. Note, this is a video interview, just over an hour long. Well worth watching if you find the time.
