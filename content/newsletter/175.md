Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #175!

Not much from me this month, I’m afraid. I’m working on a two articles which are both taking time to research and write. I hope to publish at least one of those some time next month.

In the meantime, here’s my top picks of what’s been happening in design, code and typography over the month of April 2021.

## Thought provoking

“Does the default option or standard use the least amount of energy possible?”

In [Green by Default](https://blr.design/blog/green-by-default/) Brian Louis Ramirez explains how defaults can be used to save energy and thereby reduce CO₂ emissions in technology.

Here’s another quote I liked, also taken from Brian’s article.

“The goal of living was never to create a divine beauty in the world, to find a meaning to life that is as profound as it is simple. The goal is to appreciate the beauty that already exists. And the Web is that — a beautiful, beautiful place, hidden in places that so few people get to explore.”

## Design and Code

“....with normal life edging closer and closer, it’s not a virtual escape we’re craving. It’s an escape from the virtual. We need a vacation.” [Meet the New “Leisure-Enhancing” Sunscreen Brand Partying Like It’s 1986](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/04/vacation-by-poolside-fm-sunscreen). Everything about this is genius.
