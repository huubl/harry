Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #145, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

“Individually, there’s little we can do; but collectively, there’s not much we can’t.” In [Power](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/power/), Ethan Marcotte shares his thoughts about how to start making changes in the tech industry.

[White Guyde To The Galaxy](https://tatianamac.com/posts/white-guyde/). If you are a white guy and you don't know what to do beyond donate and being quiet, Tatiana Mac made you a list.

[Equivalent Experiences: What Are They?](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/equivalent-experiences-part1/) An equivalent experience is one that has been deliberately conceived of and built to be able to be used by the widest possible range of people. To create an equivalent experience, you must understand all the different ways people interact with technology, as well as common barriers they experience.

## Design and Code

## Typography

[I love typography Quiz: Glorious Glyphs](https://ilovetypography.com/2020/05/25/ilt-quiz-glorious-glyphs/). Identify the font , not from a string of letters, but from just one character, or glyph. A fun game to help you improve your type knowledge.

[Fontocalypse Now?](https://www.commarts.com/columns/fontocalypse-now) The font world has transformed in the past decade. Libre fonts, web fonts, subscriptions and globalization have changed how people get fonts, how type designers make money from fonts and who those type designers are.

[Supergravity](https://hungarumlaut.com/typefaces/supergravity.html) is a display sans inspired by old Hungarian posters from the beginning of the 20th century. The letters are very condensed, they have some contrast, the terminals of the diagonal characters (A,W,w…) are not horizontal. Best used for titles with very tight leading, that’s why the descenders are very short, almost nothing.
