Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Good articles if you build static sites

I wrote a quick article about [static site form handling with Netlify](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/forms-with-netlify/). If you use Netlify to deploy your site this is the fastest and easiest way to collect form submissions (for free) and have them sent to your email. Trust me [I’ve tried them all](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/form-data-with-zapier/).

And another on [managing internal and external links in Hugo](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/hugo-external-articles/). If you’ve built a site using Hugo and publish articles in various places on the internet (like Medium) then this one should come in handy.

## Automation and Productivity

You may not be interested in [How to Manage Freelancers](https://zapier.com/blog/how-to-manage-freelancers/) but this is an awesome case study of using Zapier, Calendly and Airtable to create a systems which run on autopilot, freeing your time to be productive elsewhere in your business.

## Useful tools for UI designers

[UI Faces](https://uifaces.co/) is an awesome API for avatars to use in Sketch projects. If you have a twitter account [you can even submit your own](https://uifaces.co/add-twitter-photo) to be used by the community.

[Interface Lovers](https://interfacelovers.com/) for interviews with well respected designers, which I still feel there is a real lack of.

Ever needed landing page inspiration beyond the usual stuff you find on Dribbble? Here are my go to resources:

[Lapa](https://www.lapa.ninja/), [Pages](https://www.pages.xyz/), [Land Book](https://land-book.com/) and [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/).

## Book recommendations for building indie businesses

I dug into this thread on [book recommendations for indie businesses](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/any-book-recommendations-for-building-your-own-indie-business-22a3f89d27) and discovered [Side Project Books](https://books.makesideproject.com/), an awesome collection of reading material for for anyone interested in building a business on the side.

## Watches on AI, Humanity and focus

“Nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital super-intelligence” says [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/982119546420002817).

Watch Chris Paine’s new AI movie [Don’t trust Your Computer](http://doyoutrustthiscomputer.org/watch) for free until Sunday night.
