Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week:

1. The secret behind [the subway drawings](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=keith+haring+subway+drawings&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5k5Otu6fWAhVCalAKHRbOBWgQ_AUICigB&biw=1271&bih=776) which launched [Keith Haring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Haring) toward popular stardom was [semiotics](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=semiotics&oq=semiotics&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j0l2.1202j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), according to the documentary [Drawing the Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPlzHR_WyVA&t=56s), filmed shortly before his death in 1990. Haring created a visual language which was both “accessible and generic enough that his work could be accepted by anyone without any critical intervention”. Here's [a gallery of almost all Haring's posters](https://photos.app.goo.gl/wb2mjmrsbT7HcOTi2) which I snapped last week whilst walking round the [Keith Haring: Posters](http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/exhibitions/current/keith-haring.html) exhibition in Hamburg.

2. [The Maccabees](http://www.themaccabees.co.uk/) frontman [Orlando Weeks](https://www.orlandoweeks.co.uk/) returns to illustration in a new book and album. Another illustrator who caught my eye this week is [Lennard Kok](http://www.lennardkok.com/). I find the minimal approach to [his geometric pencil drawings](http://www.lennardkok.com/#/pencil-drawings/) incredibly satisfying. [This feature on It's Nice That](http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/lennard-kok-apartamento-apc-illustration-070917) is also worth a look.

3. [Erik D. Kennedy](http://erikdkennedy.com/) released his monster of a course [Learn UI Design](http://learnui.design/) this week. His two part article [7 Rules for Creating Georgeous UI](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda) is a good starting point if you're not familiar with his work and are involved in designing internet things.
4. [The importance of negative space](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=The+importance+of+whitespace&oq=The+importance+of+whitespace&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.313j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) kept coming up in conversation this week. Nick Babich sums the idea up far more coherently than I ever could in his article [Mastering the Power of Nothing](https://medium.springboard.com/mastering-the-power-of-nothing-a9f6971f1fd).

5. For your ears: A while back I mentioned Essex born [Stuart Howard a.k.a Lapalux](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lapalux-ruinism/) had a new album on the way. The impressively experimental [Ruinism](https://open.spotify.com/album/6XFgLcLwDdxqdNlFW1Gv6o) is that album.
