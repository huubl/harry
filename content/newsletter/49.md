Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## More on Design Systems

[5 tips from an Airbnb designer on maintaining a design system](https://www.designsystems.com/stories/airbnb-designer-shares-pro-tips-for-maintaining-a-design-system/) by Jeremy Dizon is taken from [Design Systems](https://www.designsystems.com/), a great resource for learning, creating and evangelizing design systems. Another project from the folks behind [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), the collaborative in browser design tool.

## GDPR with Mailchimp

If you keep a mailing list like this one and your based in the EU, in order to remain compliant with the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation, you’ll have to ask for consent from your subscribers before the May 25, 2018. For those of us using Mailchimp, luckily the process is fairly straight forward.

[Collect Consent with GDPR Forms](https://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/collect-consent-with-gdpr-forms) will help you get started. For an in depth video tutorial checkout [How to Add GDPR Options to a MailChimp Sign Up Form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8O5w4BglTA) from Larry Snow.

## Typography

“We have specific business needs around brand distinction, legibility, and scalability, that no available typefaces were addressing. We wanted a typeface that would function beautifully online and offline while reflecting our brand personality, so we decided to craft our own” says Derek Chan, Creative Lead at Airbnb.

[Airbnb Cereal](https://airbnb.design/introducing-airbnb-cereal/) is the new workhorse type family designed in collaboration with [Dalton Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/work/airbnb). A playful, open, and simple typeface with a touch of quirk designed to scale from button to billboard.

[When East Meets West: Web Typography And How It Can Inspire modern layouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqxo269aORM) is a fascinating talk by [Chen Hui Jing](https://www.chenhuijing.com/).

## Good reads on CSS

[New CSS Features That Are Changing Web Design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/future-of-web-design/) by [Zell Liew](https://zellwk.com/) is stuffed full of useful resources on CSS Grid, designing with irregular shapes and switching text flows with CSS `writing-mode` property.

[CSS Grid — Responsive layouts and components](https://medium.com/deemaze-software/css-grid-responsive-layouts-and-components-eee1badd5a2f) is also a great read for more actionable layouts with Grid.

## For your ears

Enjoying the new one from [Royce da 5'9" - Caterpillar ft. Eminem, King Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dARAN1z2KqY). Eminem back to his best? I’ll leave that for you to decide.
