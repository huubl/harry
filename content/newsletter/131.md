Welcome to issue #131, your weekly roundup of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

## Thought provoking

## Design and Code

“Front-end developers have significantly more power and autonomy to create full-featured apps as the back-end is being moved more and more into services.” Jason Lengstorf launches his new course [Introduction to the JAMStack](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/jamstack/).

## Typography

“I love when I’m able to help a designer find their best ideas—even if it’s a bit of a busman’s holiday, since working with type designers is what I do all day at H&Co.”

[You can now get a free typography crit from Jonathan Hoefler](https://www.fastcompany.com/90467428/meet-the-10-most-overpaid-ceos-in-the-u-s) by DMing him on Twitter.
