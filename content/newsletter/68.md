Hi Folks,

A few links I felt were worth sharing this week...

## Thought provoking

_“As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.”_ – Ralph Waldo Emerson

[The Farnam Street Principles](https://fs.blog/principles/) are well worth a read.

[The ultimate web design tool: a browser](https://logrocket.com/blog/ultimate-web-design-tool) – If designing in the browser was once laborious and constraining, it is now anything but. Important read from Oliver Williams.

## Design and Code

[Keys to maintainable CSS: Order](https://pyx.space/post/keys-to-maintainable-css-order). Krisztian Puska shares her insight on sorting CSS declarations.

[Building Your Color Palette](https://refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette/), a good read for anyone who works on UI’s.

## Typography

[Why are tech companies making custom typefaces?](https://www.arun.is/blog/custom-typefaces/) Arun Venkatesan on the growing trend.

[UCity](http://fatypeflux.com/) is a new take on U8, a typeface based on Berlin underground signs from Fatype.
