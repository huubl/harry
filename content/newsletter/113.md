Hey everyone,

Welcome to issue #113, a weekly round up of what’s happening in design, code and typography.

If you read one thing this week make it [The World-Wide Work](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-world-wide-work/), Ethan Marcotte’s fantastic talk on automation, power, justice, and labor in the tech industry.

An excellent piece exploring the influence of design, how patterns in the live cycle of technology impact society and how union and collaboration provide both power and leverage.

## Thought provoking

“We have to look at design as an agent of power. Of something capable of good, yes, but of something equally capable of harm. Even if we don’t always mean to do it, our work can privilege the privileged, and exclude marginalized populations.” [The World-Wide Work](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-world-wide-work/).

[James Clear and Cal Newport](https://soundcloud.com/jamesclear/james-clear-and-cal-newport) discuss focus, habits, and productivity in an 1-hour long discussion.

## Typography

## Something to watch

In the future, DX and UX will merge and content management will be more visual while giving devs the control they need.
