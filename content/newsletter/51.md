Hi folks,

Here are a few things I thought were worth sharing this week.

## Indie Hacking Websites

[Small Victories](http://www.smallvictori.es/) takes files in a Dropbox folder and turns them into a website. Such a great tool for launching ideas on the internet fast without having to code.

For those who do code, this case study on [using the HTML theme to build a custom site and client-facing CMS](http://blog.smallvictori.es/170323-case-study-le-fleuriste_feature#using-the-html-theme-to-build-a-custom-site-and-client-facing-cms) will give you an idea of exactly what you can do with it.

[Carrd](https://carrd.co/) is another great option for simple, free, fully responsive one-page sites. Great for landing pages and quick data capture.

## On typography

[Op. Cit. Ibid.](http://www.opcitibid.xyz/) is a new type Foundry created by designer [Kia Tasbihgou](http://www.kiatas.me/), who’s design work you may recognise from [Frank Ocean singles](https://thevastnothingnessofspace.tumblr.com/post/174460981635/via-design-practice-of-kia-tasbihgou). Absolutely love the quirky ‘f’ in Propos.

Two other typefaces I’m enjoying right now are the [Ginto](http://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/ginto) family by [Dinamo](http://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/) and [SangBleu from Swiss Typefaces](https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/sangbleu/).

[Fonts in Use](https://fontsinuse.com/) is a great tool for identifying typography in graphic design. I spend so much time on [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/) I often forget it exists!

## For your ears

[The Best That Ever Did It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pey6Q4ZFhjU), from all time best beat maker [J Dilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Dilla).
