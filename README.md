## Prerequisites

You need to have the latest/LTS [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) versions installed in order to use Victor Hugo.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/harrycresswell/harry.git
```

Then run:

```
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies.

## Local development

To start a local development server at at `https://localhost:1313/` run:

```
npm start
```

This is a simple NPM Script which `hugo server --disableFastRender`.

## Production build

Whe your ready to build a production ready site, update the `baseUrl` inside `config.toml` then run:

```
npm run clean && npm run build
```

This will remove the `/public` folder and run a fresh build ready for production.

## Basic concepts

A few of the basic concepts to get the most out of using this theme.

### Adding Content

Create a new markdown file in the `./content/articles` directory:

```
hugo new articles/my-new-article.md
```

Create a new page in the `./content/page` directory:

```
hugo new page/my-new/page.md
```

Follow the same steps for notes and projects.

### Writing Sass

Write your **Sass** inside `./assets/scss`.

With the server running (`npm start`) Hugo will watch your Sass for changes, then pipe them to `./public/css/main.css` and reload the browser.

### Making layout changes

To make changes to the layout head to `./themes/hc-starter` where you will find `/layouts`. Inside there you will find templates for partials, shortcodes and taxonomies.
